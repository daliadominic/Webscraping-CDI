€3,500.00. The MinFarm LoRaWAN Gateway is the only solution on the market today that supports LoRaWAN in locations with no telecommunication or power infrastructure. Using the Iridium Short Burst Data (SBD) satellite services the MinFarm LoRaWAN Gateway provides LoRa coverage to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) LoRa sensors anywhere in the world. In ultra low power mode the MinFarm LoRaWAN Gateway can power from a single 50 W solar panel for continuous operation. The MinFarm LoRaWAN Gateway is an IP67 unit, tested for year round operation in extreme outdoor environments..   
 Estimated Shipment: Max. 30 days. In stock. — OR —. Remote dam monitoring requires engineers to make onsite visits to measure key safety metrics. These onsite visits to locations that are often extremely remote are expensive and do not occur on a frequent basis. LoRaWAN sensors with satellite connectivity offers 24/7 availability of key sensor metrics, that can enable remote engineers, take decisions regarding the safety of the dam and when onsite visits are necessary. This leads to lower running costs of dam maintenance, better flood monitoring and real-time warning systems.. • Remote water pipe monitoring with LoRaWAN. Remote pipeline monitoring with a MinFarm LoRaWAN Gateway,  both reduces the requirement for onsite maintenance visits by engineers to pipeline infrastructure and greatly enhances the effectiveness of such visits to identify pipeline components that are leading to water loss. A single MinFarm LoRaWAN Gateway is capable of giving up to 15 km radius coverage to multiple water sensors that monitor water levels. The Gateway can operate entirely off-grid, drawing power from a single 50 W solar panel and communicating via Inmarsat or Iridium packet data services. Both grid power and terrestrial communications infrastructure are typically absent or unreliable over the entirety of a remote pipeline. Where leakage of water can be anywhere between 20% to 50% of water supply, realtime data provided to remote engineers via low cost satellite links is a very effective way to improve water infrastructure performance..

101,"OnePlus wants to release affordable smartphones in the future, which suggests the imminent launch of OnePlus Z. . OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has seemingly confirmed the existence of the long-rumoured OnePlus Z. The company confirmed its plans to launch affordable smartphones in the near future. “We’re shifting strategies after six years of the smartphone business,” OnePlus CEP Pete Lau said in an interview with FastCompany. The brand is not only looking to make cheaper OnePlus phones, but it is also planning to expand into new product categories in India. The last affordable smartphone from the brand, to recall, was the OnePlus X in 2015. It now seems OnePlus is ready to get back into the affordable smartphone segment with the OnePlus Z. “The ultimate goal is to sell a lot of phones with lower price tags, then spin them into an ecosystem of connected devices,” Lau added.. The OnePlus Z is likely to launch in India first and then make its debut in other markets such as North America and Europe, although the company is yet to officially confirm the name of the phone or its launch timeline. Pete Lau clarifies that the vision of his company will not change as it will continue to make quality products. There will an announcement regarding the new strategy from OnePlus soon.. Separately, OnePlus is aiming to diversify its product lineup and build an ecosystem of connected devices. “We indeed have come from background and roots as a hardware company, but from what we see looking forward, building an ecosystem is a forward trend,” as per a post by Lau on Weibo. He didn’t reveal any of those products yet, but we may expect devices other than smartphones and smart TVs such as smart home products and OnePlus TWS earphones that were rumoured about recently.. OnePlus Z specs rumoured so far include a 6.4-inch FHD+ AMOLED punch-hole display with a 90Hz refresh rate, much like the OnePlus 8. The phone is tipped to be powered by Snapdragon 765 chipset paired with 5G support, up to 8GB RAM and 256GB internal storage. For photography, the OnePlus Z could sport triple rear camera setup that may consist of a 48MP main sensor, a 16MP secondary sensor, and a 12MP sensor. Rumours also suggest the phone will house a 4,000mAh battery and support 30W fast charging. As an affordable OnePlus phone, you should not expect premium features like IP rating for water-resistance as well as wireless charging.. ",0
102,"Motorola One Fusion+ is tipped to launch in Q2 2020.. . Motorola One Fusion and One Fusion+ phones are in the works with codenames Titan and Liberty. 91mobiles exclusively revealed key specifications of the One Fusion+, which will be an affordable offering and launch in at least India and the US. Now, the same handset is listed on the YouTube Device Report page with key specifications, including information about its display, chipset, Android version, and battery capacity. This also confirms the phone will be called ‘Motorola One Fusion+’. However, the render in the listing is of Motorola Edge+ and not the One Fusion+ itself.. According to the YouTube Device Report page, the Motorola One Fusion+ sports a 6.5-inch full HD+ display and will boot Android 10 OS. It is said to pack a 5,000mAh battery and be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730, which is confusing as sources earlier claimed it should ship with Snapdragon 675 SoC. The listing reveals the Motorola One Fusion+ would launch as early as June 2020, in-line with previous leaks.. As for the other specifications, the Motorola One Fusion+ is said to feature a 12MP primary camera, come in 4GB/6GB RAM options and 64GB/ 128GB storage options. The handset will be available in Light Blue and Light brown colour options. Connectivity options include dual-SIM and NFC. Unfortunately, not much else is known about the Motorola One Fusion+ at the moment, but considering the launch is just a month away from now, we should know more soon.. ",0

1,"The challenges surrounding IoT security remain today’s primary adoption rate inhibitor. Along with VPNs, a popular solution to today's IoT security challenge is found in software-defined perimeters (SDPs).. When history looks back on the innovations of this century, the Internet of Things (IoT) will most certainly stand out as one of the most impactful and transformative technologies of our time.. Today’s estimates indicate that IoT will reach the 30-billion-devices mark within the next few years. Take a moment to let that number sink in. That’s 30 billion smart devices and counting, with each one connected to clouds and edge gateways via IP networks, generating, collecting, processing and moving data faster than any other application via IoT’s continuous, real-time streaming of sensor sources. With use cases spanning virtually every industry around the world, from smart cars, to healthcare, to airline travel, to nations’ power grids, to the military, to your Fitbit, the possibilities for its applications are endless. Unfortunately, so are its cybersecurity vulnerabilities—well, perhaps not endless but certainly significant.. The challenges surrounding IoT security remain today’s primary adoption rate inhibitor. This is primarily due to the fact that IoT devices are typically deployed outside an organization’s traditional enterprise boundaries, making their protection, and that of their associated data, particularly daunting. Moreover, these endpoints are designed for lightweight data transmissions, not enterprise-class security protocols, which adds to the challenges.. Software-defined perimeters (SDP) have been gaining notoriety in the area of IoT, and for good reason. SDP’s flexible, fine-grained security has proven itself able to excel in IoT settings as well as any type of cloud environment. Lightweight and portable enough to be installed in the most inexpensive of endpoint devices, this solution leverages several measures to conceal data transmissions from anyone but the sender or receiver. By leveraging SDP, organizations can protect endpoint devices, edge gateways, and centralized clouds to realize IoT’s advantages while virtually eliminating its risks.. It’s challenging to determine which aspect of IoT security is more inhibitive: the fact that transmissions originate outside the perimeters of conventional enterprise cybersecurity boundaries, or that the devices aren’t engineered for modern security challenges. The reality is that even if devices are behind traditional cybersecurity perimeter defenses, like virtual private networks (VPNs) or firewalls, the increasing numbers of data breaches indicate they would be just as vulnerable. VPNs aren’t suitable for IoT use cases because organizations don’t own the physical infrastructure in the public cloud to properly implement gateways there. Also, it’s difficult for VPNs to match the scale of the containers frequently deployed in the IoT while the connections themselves are unreliable.. The diminished hardware, storage, and compute capacity of endpoint devices make them inherently vulnerable; these are often the result of the need to conserve costs. The value and efficacy of IoT deployments are based on deploying as many devices as possible, as quickly as possible, across distributed settings for fast data transmissions delivering real-time insight, like linking fuel dispensers in the oil and gas industry for visibility into fuel consumption and asset monitoring. Costs would rapidly escalate if organizations had to equip each endpoint device with the capabilities of more expensive hardware, which would in turn limit the ability to distribute these devices, and consequently the follow-on value they would produce.. The ability to enjoy a discreet data transmission by way of isolation is an inherent benefit of SDP. In other words, SDP overcomes the limited cybersecurity capabilities of endpoint devices and the fact that they’re outside typical perimeter defenses. Moreover, SDP enhances the overall security of distributed networks by fortifying both ends: the devices and edge-computing gateways, and public and private centralized clouds.. Turning again to the oil and gas industry example, organizations can directly transmit data from containers in fuel pumps to the cloud for analytics by deploying lightweight gateways on each end. These gateways are securely introduced to one another by a matchmaking service in the cloud by way of a random port generation. After the gateways are introduced, secure micro-tunnels can be deployed between the gateways that enable invisible communication that’s nearly impossible to detect.. The security advantages of the SDP approach are considerable: data transmissions are discreet, micro-tunnels leverage enhanced UDP for security by obscurity, and the random port generation makes it difficult to “stake out” ports, yet the business value might be even greater. The network isolation enabled by this method ensures that there are distinct transmissions for payments, rewards programs, and fuel monitoring, which greatly mitigates the possibility of distributed denial of service attacks and lateral movement that can jeopardize IoT. This way, IoT’s transmissions don’t tax additional network resources for communicating between locations at different gas stations, for example. Moreover, the ability to continuously monitor them significantly increases the capacity to adhere to federal and state regulations regarding fuel leaks and environmental hazards. Finally, the micro-tunnels’ direct connections enable gas stations to comply with additional regulations, such as the upcoming EMV chip card secure payment compliance deadline.. As undeniable as the above use case is, it’s critical to understand that an SDP approach provides these same core cybersecurity benefits of cloaked data transmissions for any IoT use case. The previous example is so eminent because it attests to the comprehensive value of this approach, which doesn’t just secure data coming from IoT devices to the cloud, but it also helps stabilize the overall networks supporting these operations.. Each of the numerous types of data common to these and other use cases—such as payment information, customer rewards data, and data about the fuel itself—can be isolated and directed to its destination without involving the other types of data. Moreover, the micro-tunnels delivering the data have automatic failover capabilities for inherent resiliency that’s critical in low-latent IoT applications. If ever one was to go down for any reason, data transmissions would failover to another to minimize downtime and increase overall network stability.. To reap the benefit of IoT’s projected adoption rates, and to enable it to become as powerful as it can be across verticals, organizations must address the basic cybersecurity issues that are impeding its progress. As discussed, the most pressing concern today is that of security. This is not an unreasonable concern. According to Risk Based Security’s recently released report, during the first six months of 2019, there were a total of 3,813 security breaches; that’s about 20 per day.. Software-defined perimeters enable organizations to facilitate trustworthy cybersecurity in a manner lightweight enough for endpoint devices and optimal for data transmissions stemming from remote locations. The appropriate implementation of this method reinforces the line of business advantages the IoT is hailed for while stabilizing the data transmissions of organizations’ networks in general. This approach can make a critical difference in turning the IoT’s projections into concrete reality.. Written by Don Boxley, Jr., co-founder and CEO of DH2i.. . . ",0
2,"Shadow IoT, the devices that IT and security departments are unaware of, poses a serious threat to enterprise networks. It's essential to understand the dangers and solutions to shadow IoT.. The line between reality and science fiction is beginning to blur. Scenarios that used to be reserved for movies such as Terminator, The Matrix or Inception are quickly becoming a part of our daily lives. The internet itself is something of a technological miracle.. Who could have imagined that we could develop a way to connect the far reaches of the globe into one massive system, and all in the span of a few decades? But things haven’t stopped there. In fact, what we’re seeing today is the next step in the evolution of the internet.. This new step is defined by a tendency to connect more and more devices to the web, leading to what’s called the Internet of Things (IoT). The numbers speak for themselves. In 2017 there were over 8.4 billion IoT devices, and the number is projected to reach 30 billion by 2020, while the market value of IoT is estimated to reach $7.1 trillion in the same year.. The reason for this rapid development is because IoT has shown the potential to revolutionize business, industry, agriculture, medicine and society as a whole. However, this attempt to integrate the physical world with its digital counterpart came with its own share of drawbacks. The topic of this article is one such drawback, the so-called shadow IoT.. This phrase refers to IoT devices that have been brought into business environments without anyone’s knowledge or approval. Such devices represent a major security risk, and they can cause lasting harm to an organization. In this article, we’ll explore a number of methods organizations can use to mitigate the risks associated with shadow IoT.. The main reason why shadow IoT poses a risk for an organization is the lack of awareness surrounding it. Because most organizations haven’t experienced a cyber-attack by way of shadow IoT, they become complacent and treat it as an issue that others have to deal with. This kind of attitude, combined with ignorance, is what makes companies vulnerable to shadow IoT in the first place.. In theory, this issue is easy to solve – all you have to do is raise awareness about the dangers of shadow IoT. In practice, however, this solution isn’t easy to implement. Since the threat is still fairly new, there are a lot of unknowns surrounding shadow IoT. Still, widely publicized cases such as the Mirai Botnet attacks from 2016 are good indicators of what hackers can achieve. Hosting security training seminars for employees is a good starting point for raising security awareness within an organization.. Businesses that provide your company with equipment and services are just as likely to succumb to IoT-based attacks as you are. What makes this threat particularly insidious is the fact that it can come from sources you trust. The issue is further exacerbated by the fact that a lot of companies rely on complex supply chains and multiple vendors in order to operate, which increases the number of attack vectors substantially.. The first line of defense against vendor-based attacks is to assess the safety of internet-capable products your company purchases. This should be done during the selection process and post-purchase. A more drastic solution would be to perform security audits for your key suppliers. The goal here is to ensure that vendors are upholding the appropriate safety standards and procedures they advertise pre-purchase.. Personal IT devices are the main culprits of shadow IoT. It’s difficult to manage what each member of an organization brings to work. The list of IoT-enabled devices people tend to carry around increases every year. Wearables such as fitness activity trackers, smartphones, smartwatches, digital assistants and medical devices are the main offenders here. The number of these potential attack vectors is what makes shadow IoT such a major threat. If even one of these devices gets compromised while being connected to a company network, hackers can use it as a gateway to attack company assets such as computers, printers and even thermostats.. Introducing security policies for managing employees’ use of personal electronic devices in the workplace is the first step towards minimizing the risk from Shadow IoT. Such policies should be compliant with information security standards such as the ISO 27001, or an equivalent. The next step would be to create a BYOD policy in order to establish a strong culture of information security within an organization. Beyond that, you can give IT administrators the ability to enforce these policies by allowing them to inspect non-compliant devices.. It’s impossible to completely insulate an organization from shadow IoT attacks. If hackers are determined enough, they can breach any security system, so investing in cybersecurity beyond a certain point will only bring diminishing returns. What becomes more important is the way an organization behaves in an event of an attack. If an organization doesn’t have a shadow IoT breach strategy in place before the attack, hackers can cause substantially more damage.. The way you prepare for a shadow IoT attack is the same as the way you would prepare for an environmental hazard. The key is to have a plan, keep it updated and train staff through simulated breach scenarios. This will allow you to minimize the damage caused by an attack.. IoT is the way of the future, for better or for worse. The number of internet-capable devices is steadily multiplying, and each of them carries the seed of a potential attack. There’s little that organizations can do to stem the tide. . What they can do is strengthen their security by implementing the appropriate policies, raise awareness among members about the risks involved and prepare a fallback strategy in order to brace for the inevitable..

3,"The network is now the focal point for enterprise security. To prevent intrusion and ensure that only the proper devices have access, security and network personnel must collaborate closely.. An automated light switch, a temperature control system in an office building or a digital sign found in a school cafeteria, all of these have something in common, they can make a network vulnerable once connected to the Internet. The Internet of Things (IoT) presents a growing attack surface for bad actors who find ever more creative ways to exploit devices, be it ones in living rooms or used for businesses, namely building control systems.. The network is now the focal point for IoT security. The devices connect to the network and the network touches all data and workloads. This is how hackers can move laterally to compromise whatever systems and data are on the network. Through the network, users and devices can be authenticated, policies and rules put in place to control access and behavior and visibility can be increased to detect anomalies. IT professionals and security operations teams must adapt to this new reality if enterprise networks and sensitive data are to remain protected.  The ever-increasing amount of connected IoT devices comes with an almost equal number of challenges:. Security deployed around the network’s perimeter is blind to such communications unless the enterprise is watching the internal network. And many simply aren’t. If those devices are compromised, they become a launching pad into other parts of the network. The school district’s digital sign is proof-positive here.. The top IoT issue is that you shouldn’t rely on physical security to keep things off a network. There are many places in the wired network that are wide open, and there’s little network access control. There’s more control and authentication on the wireless side, but, even there, devices that are authenticated often get dropped into an internal VLAN and from there are uncontrolled.. Key steps that can be taken to better protect an enterprise network:. Key to the issue of IoT security as we look to the future is the growing need for security and networking folks to talk to one another. Making collaboration happen is easier said than done. In fact, the two groups can be adversarial, as they’re seeking different outcomes. Network operators are happy if all the network packets are flowing quickly with high availability and low latency — even if all those packets are carrying malicious traffic. The security group would probably be happiest if nothing flowed through the network at all.. The network plays a critical role in two areas: first, detecting when an attack is taking place, and second, responding to the attack by shutting down the device, limiting it or slowing it down. There’s much you can do with the network infrastructure. IT personnel will almost always want to depend on network firewalls for solving security problems, but don’t tend to use a firewall for every single switch port. The security capabilities must be built into the network itself.. That’ll mean cooperation between network and security groups. Because this is a cultural issue, it will need to start with high-level executives. That doesn’t necessarily mean both sides will report into the same structure. However, the security pros will have to determine what needs to be protected and the network folks will have to decide how to make it happen, all the way at the network edge where the devices connect.. Bringing IT and security groups together is a constant challenge, yet a necessary one to overcome. Without it, there will be more data breaches coming from a wider variety of things rather than end-user systems. HVAC controllers, TV screens, parking toll machines and other IoT devices will continue to be exploited by attackers seeking the easiest entry points into critical parts of the network. And, the IoT devices won’t be getting better from a security perspective anytime soon because many of the makers of these things aren’t focusing on that..

4,"IoT networks can both amplify and be the targets of distributed denial of service (DDoS) or botnet attacks. Architect resilient solutions to properly secure your devices.. Cybercriminals have many different ways of exploiting network vulnerabilities and weak spots in our cyber defenses. Considering that the number of devices we use on a daily basis is growing, more avenues of exploitation will be open to cybercriminals — unless we close those pathways.. Distributed Denial of Service, or “DDoS,” attacks on IoT networks via botnets have been especially alarming and difficult to counter. Let’s have a closer look at DDoS attacks, botnets and ways of protecting against them.. A simple principle governs a “denial-of-service” attack: attackers attempt to deny service to legitimate users. Some typical examples might include attackers overwhelming a server or cluster with requests, disrupting everyone’s access to the site or focusing the attack on a particular target who will be denied access.. With DDoS, the attacker usually has one of three goals:. DDoS attacks can be performed on their own or as part of a more massive attack on an organization. It usually targets bandwidth or processing resources like memory and CPU cycles. However, the type of DDoS attacks where we often see IoT devices used is a botnet attack.. A botnet is a group of connected computers that work together on performing repetitive tasks, and it doesn’t necessarily have a malicious purpose. Unfortunately, it’s possible for an attacker to take control of a botnet by infecting a vulnerable device with malware. Then they can use the network as a group of devices to perform DDoS attacks that can be much more dangerous, depending on the number of mechanisms involved. What’s more, since IoT devices often interact in the physical world in ways that other IT devices don’t, it’s difficult to monitor and safeguard them.. If we strive to protect IoT devices the same way we protect our conventional IT devices, there will invariably be faults in the system that cybercriminals might exploit. To eliminate vulnerabilities, we must think of IoT protection in its own terms and take into account the various types of IoT use when we do.. Even though the threat of botnets can’t wholly be eradicated, there are still ways to limit the impact and the scope of these attacks by taking preventative actions. One of them is placing IoT devices on a segmented network protected from external traffic. It’s also crucial to start monitoring the systems and invest in developing intrusion detection processes which would go a long way in warning a user that the system is being compromised.. How can each layer of your IoT solution stack be architected not to trust any other part naively? Think about that as you design your solution. Find ways to make your network more resilient. Model botnet attacks and test disaster scenario responses.. In addition to network segmentation and testing, we also shouldn’t forget fundamental security measures, such as timely firmware and software patching and the ability to control who can access a particular device, which every IoT solution should take care of.. IoT is a developing technology that we must make as secure as possible, tempering its frenetic evolution with necessary security protocols and standards. Considering how quickly it’s being woven into our everyday lives, businesses and homes, IoT developers, manufacturers, distributors and consumers must work together to eliminate common IoT vulnerabilities and ensure that each device is as secure as it can be from emerging threats.. .

5,"Choosing the right IoT vendor is challenging. Seven IoT platforms stand out as contenders for supporting smart city solutions and their associated use cases.. The IoT platform vendor market is highly competitive with many small and large players providing differentiated services. Just for an idea of how this market has grown over the five-year period, funding went from $1.2 billion in 2011 to nearly $3 billion in 2015, as per a report from CB Insights. While the competition is good since it gives choices and price advantages to the enterprises and businesses implementing or using these IoT platforms, the partner managers are challenged with decision making on which platform vendors to choose from.. A recent blog on IoT For All talked about 6 Decision-making criteria that will affect IoT platform vendor selection this year. It mentions six key decision-making criteria which any leadership team needs to mull over before selecting an IoT Platform vendor. The criteria are around the below 6 vectors.. When we look at the IoT platform vendor landscape, we must analyze which are the companies to watch out for in enterprise smart city solutions, which cover waste management, smart street lighting, energy and water metering and utility management. We can see that there are seven companies which are nimble and have a lot of relevance to the six decision-making criteria we see above.. Let’s talk about each of these seven companies and their strengths and alignments to the criteria mentioned above..

6,"This article provides a high-level overview of how wireless sensors work, how networks are arranged, and how they serve real-world IoT applications.. The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming our world in tremendous ways. . By enabling everyday objects to communicate wirelessly, we can automate data exchange and create new efficiencies that positively impact lives and organizations.. Underlying the IoT is wireless sensor technology, which allows us to collect information about surrounding environments over extended periods with little manual effort. Wireless sensors can be configured to measure a variety of variables, from air temperature to vibration. Overall, there are many different types of wireless sensors available in the marketplace. . Many wireless networks contain hundreds, sometimes thousands, of wireless sensors. Already, these devices are used across a wide range of sectors, including retail, agriculture, urban planning, security, and supply chain management. . In this article, we dive deeper into how wireless sensors work and explain why they’re so important for the IoT revolution.. Wireless sensors gather data about local conditions and share findings with other powerful components or platforms for further processing. Sensors are typically distributed across large geographic areas and programmed to communicate with central hubs, gateways, and servers. . One major advantage of wireless sensors is they require a low level of maintenance and a small amount of power to function. Sensors can support IoT applications for years before needing a battery change or charge. . When it comes to building wireless networks, one of the biggest questions developers face is how to arrange wireless sensors in the field. Sensors, or “nodes,” must be distributed in such a way that supports the overarching objective of the network developer.. The two most common arrangements for wireless sensors are the star and mesh topologies.. The “mesh” topology describes networks in which sensors connect to as many other nearby nodes as possible. As a result, data can “hop” from one node to the next without having to follow certain routes or sensor hierarchies. As a result, connectivity issues are less harmful to network performance as data can take multiple paths to reach processing components. Mesh topologies are also easy to expand as new sensors need only to connect to existing nodes. . On the downside, mesh topologies are costly and can be difficult to maintain. There are so many connections to create and manage, which becomes more challenging as networks grow.. The “star” topology describes networks in which every sensor connects directly to a central gateway or hub. These hubs take sensor information and transmit it to other applications for processing. In these arrangements, nodes do not communicate directly with each other. . Compared to mesh networks, star-shaped networks are more cost-effective as fewer connections are required. However, it’s harder to expand networks as any new sensors must connect central hubs, which have capacity limitations.. There are several wireless standards available that can support sensor networks.. Until recently, cellular technology was the most commonly used option for wide-area network (WAN) connectivity. However, cellular technology is expensive and consumes significant energy, which isn’t well suited for long-range, low-power devices, like wireless sensors. . Outside of cellular technology, WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Zigbee can also support wireless sensor networks. These standards also fall under the “traditional wireless solution” category but have unique advantages and disadvantages.. WiFi (“wireless fidelity”) is one of the most widely used wireless technologies today in business offices and homes. WiFi uses the 2.4GHz and 5GHz ISM frequency bands. Because WiFi is so prevalent, it’s relatively easy to leverage existing networks for wireless sensor use. . However, WiFi signals have difficulty penetrating walls, which is a disadvantage for long-range applications. Additionally, WiFi networks are managed by local routers that may not always have direct user interfaces for updating sensor keys. . BLE is a low-power protocol that is distinct from traditional Bluetooth technology. BLE uses the 2.4GHz frequency band to transmit small amounts of information. The wireless standard is less costly to use than WiFi; however, the same problems exist when it comes to sending data through walls or over long distances. In addition, BLE is susceptible to signal interference as many other devices and standards use the 2.4GHz frequency band. . Zigbee is a wireless standard that relies on mesh networking to support large numbers of nodes (>65k) within a single network. Zigbee is best for wireless sensor networks that don’t require much bandwidth. . One disadvantage of Zigbee is that some sensors must always be on in order to share information for processing. As a result, Zigbee consumes more total energy than today’s leading standards.. Although traditional wireless standards are effective, a new class has emerged that’s much more effective for wireless sensor networks. Low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) are growing as the go-to technology for long-range data transmission. LPWANs can support billions of sensors and will be used heavily for IoT applications. . LPWANs offer several advantages over traditional standards. First, they consume less power from devices because they transmit information at a much lower bit rate. Sensors can survive several years on LPWANs on a single battery charge. LPWANs can also support sensors over vast geographic areas as data can be transmitted over long distances. . From a cost perspective, deploying wireless sensors on LPWANs is less expensive compared to alternative methods. Because data rates are so low, hardware requirements are less intense. . There are several downsides to using LPWANs. LPWANs aren’t well suited for applications involving large data packets. Sensor networks that need to transfer more data should use higher capacity cellular or short-range WiFi, BLE, and Zigbee networks. Additionally, LPWANs use unlicensed radio frequencies, which can be harder to manage from an interference standpoint.. The three primary LPWANs for wireless sensors are LoRa, SigFox, and NB-IoT. . LoRa (“long range”) is a widely accepted standard that uses a chirp spread spectrum modulation scheme to transmit data over very long distances. LoRa is the foundation for LoRaWAN, a publicly available layer specification that connects wireless sensors through gateways or LoRaWAN network providers. LoRaWAN has a higher bandwidth than Sigfox and can transmit data packets more effectively through noisier environments. . With LoRaWAN, data is sent over encrypted messages between gateways and network servers. Servers authenticate and decrypt data that is ultimately sent to end applications. Users can send messages directly to wireless sensors through LoRaWAN to reconfigure devices. . LoRaWAN sensors are classified into three groups based on the ability of the sensor to send and receive messages. Class A devices remain in sleep mode until they have something to transmit. These sensors can send uplink messages at any time, which makes them especially useful in wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSAN).. Class B sensors have scheduled windows for devices to receive downlink messages from servers. Class C devices maintain an open receive window for messages unless they need to transmit information. Consequently, C sensors enable low-latency communication but consume more energy than the other classes of sensors. . With all of these LoRaWAN sensor types, network developers must have proper gateway hardware to receive data and pass information along to servers. . SigFox connects wireless sensors directly to base stations using ultra narrowband transmissions. The standard has coverage in more than 55 countries and can support more than 100 channels per sub-band in the U.S. at 600 bps. However, data packets are limited to 12 bytes, and the standard does not allow message ACKs. SigFox users pay per device and by the number of uplink and downlink messages sent per day. . NB-IoT uses existing cell tower infrastructure to provide expansive coverage for low-power devices. The standard uses guard bands for narrow channels to avoid interference and can penetrate indoor environments well. In 2018, T-Mobile added NB-IoT coverage through its 4G network. . There are several critical characteristics of well-designed wireless sensor networks.. First, nodes should be easy to locate within a network. Sensor maintenance, such as replacing batteries and updating components, is much easier when developers know where to find all their devices.. Second, sensor networks should be able to withstand node failures without widespread disruption. Topology plays a big role in how networks handle connectivity issues. Those deploying wireless sensor networks must choose topologies that can withstand component failures. . Third, networks should be easy to scale. Developers must be able to grow their wireless sensor networks efficiently without having to invest significant capital to expand. . Finally, it’s important to consider power consumption when designing a network. The wireless sensors used should align with the data demands of the IoT application. Otherwise, network managers risk spending significant time and capital on ongoing maintenance and replacement.. Already, there are many real-world examples of how wireless sensor technology is used today across a variety of industries and applications.  . The security sector has embraced wireless sensor technology in many ways. With wireless sensors, organizations can monitor their premises, identify suspicious activity, and track valuable assets. Banks can turn wireless push buttons into panic buttons for employees and retailers can install wireless window sensors on every building access point. Homeowners can also use wireless air sensors to detect harmful gases in the air, such as carbon monoxide. . On the utilities management front, wireless sensors help automate communication between critical systems and mitigate future problems. For example, water leak sensors can be mounted on walls to detect plumbing failures or pipes that may burst in the winter. Wireless rope sensors are being used in server rooms and data centers to detect the presence of water near computer hardware. . Wireless sensors are also supporting disaster management efforts. In Texas, wireless sensors are being installed on bridges that can detect water levels above a certain threshold, thus indicating potential flash flooding in the area. Wireless vibration sensors are being used in industrial plants with large machinery to predict equipment failures before they occur. . In healthcare, wireless sensors are helping care teams monitor patients in real-time. Wireless pushbuttons are serving as PERS devices in senior care facilities. Humidity sensors are helping hospital facility managers maintain healthy environmental conditions for patients. . Retailers and grocery stores are using wireless sensors on the floor to help employees create positive experiences for customers. Wireless push sensors are being installed in restrooms so shoppers can indicate when cleaning is needed. Wireless air temperature devices are helping superstores monitor refrigerators and non-cold merchandise simultaneously. . These are just a few examples of how wireless sensor networks are creating new efficiencies and impacting lives in positive ways. As the IoT space continues to grow, expect to see more innovative sensor applications that transform modern industries forever. . Written by Chris Fruci of Radio Bridge.. . ",0
7,"If you've installed Windows 10 IoT Core OS on your Raspberry Pi, make sure you learn next about SD Card Provisioning and how to set up your Raspberry PIs for a production environment.. In my previous article, we’ve seen how to Set Up Your Raspberry PI with Microsoft Windows 10 IoT Core. Yes, we were successful in flashing the Microsoft Windows 10 IoT Core OS to our Raspberry PI, but let’s try something very handy this time. The main topic we’re going to discuss here  is SD Card Provisioning. Let’s say you have a Raspberry PI with a working OS on it, whether it’s a Microsoft IoT OS or Raspbian. And you might also have an application which runs on your Raspberry Pi. That’s good. But what if you have 100 Raspberry PIs and you need to set up your Raspberry PIs for a production environment? In this article, we’re going to start a series of articles on SD Card Provisioning. For now, let’s just start doing some amazing things.. I’m glad that you have a Raspberry PI with Windows 10 IoT core OS. While setting up your OS, you might have downloaded the IoT Dashboard and flashed the IoT OS to your SD card manually. As I mentioned in the introduction, this isn’t a normal scenario when you want to connect multiple (let’s say 100) Raspberry PIs. Flashing the OS by using the Dashboard application might not be a good idea in this case. What should we do, then? That’s where PowerShell comes into play. We’re going to try out some PowerShell commands to do all those mentioned jobs for us.. (Above: Raspberry PI). First, we always need some prerequisites. You can see all the prerequisites here. In this part, we’re only going to need the following tools:. I assume that you’ve already gone through the Prerequisites and followed the instructions. If not, please check again.. To get started, please go to the cloned location of the repository iot-adk-addonkit, where you will find a Windows Command Script IoTCorePShell.cmd. Double click on the same file and it will open a PowerShell with administrative privilege. Now, this is where the game starts. Once it opens, it will do some initial processes for us.. Now let’s create a workspace.. Now we’ve successfully created a workspace. Please note that the BSPPKG_DIR is “C:Program Files (x86)Windows Kits10MSPackagesretailarmfre”. I strongly recommend you to check if you have the contents in the folder. If not, you might not have installed the packages mentioned in the prerequisites.. Now it’s time to think about the BSP, aka the Board Support Package. Since we’re using a Raspberry PI, we can directly download the RPi_BSP.zip file from the GitHub release page. Then you can perform the below commands.. If everything is correct, you should see an output like the one below.. Once you’ve created the workspace and extracted the BSP, it’s time to build all of our packages.. If you miss this step before you go to the next step, you will get an error when you build your image like the one below.. You will also end up with an issue similar to this one: GitHub issue. Trust me, finding the root cause of this issue took me some hours and, at the end, I provided my findings here in StackOverflow.. Once the build is successful, you should be able to see the cab files in your workspace location, in my case, it’s in C:OEEBuildarmpkgs.. Now, let’s create a new Product; consider this the device we’re building an image for. We’ll be using the BSP we have extracted for this step.. You’ll be asked the Manufacturer Name (OEM Name), Family, SKU, BaseboardManufacturer and BaseboardProduct. You can get the BaseProductName from your Workspace location, in my case, C:OEESource-armBSP. You can see the sample command here in the preceding image.. The command shown in the image will generate a new Product in the Workspace location C:OEESource-armProductsOEEIoTCore.. We’re almost done, so let’s eject all the removable devices from the system and then run the below command.. This command will give you the FFU image with your base image.. You can also see the logs in your workspace location in the build folder. The generated FFU image(Flash.ffu) will be available at C:OEEBuildarmOEEIoTCoreTest folder.. Now that we have a fully functional FFU image and the only thing left is to write some bat commands to flash it to SD card, which you can do using the DISM. Let’s create a text file called format.txt and write some commands like the following.. We’re selecting disk 1, considering the fact that only one removable disk has been connected to your machine. Then we format the disk. This format.txt file will be used in our bat file write.bat.. The logs will be added to the file called log.txt. The command ImageFile:Flash.ffu is the place where we assign our FFU image. Let’s go to the folder where these three files have been placed and open a command prompt in administrative power.. Now that our OS is flashed, it’s time to connect the SD card to the Raspberry PI and connect a monitor, mouse, keyboard and ethernet to the Raspberry PI. You will see the default IoT core application running. You can also check in the device portal using the IoT Dashboard application. If you’re not sure how, please read my previous post.. Now we have learned:. In the next article we’ll learn:. . ",0
8,"While the budget and cost of ownership with a build-versus-buy aspect have been key criteria in the decision-making process, other criteria like the flexibility of the platform, vendor lock-ins, and scalability are equally important, if not more.. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a domain that is driven by volume, velocity and variety, so it helps to be very picky about the choices you make. Better technologies continue to emerge to cater to the myriad IoT use cases. What you need are solid decision-making criteria to help you choose the right IoT platform vendor. .  Chris McCann, in his blog “Internet of Things (IoT) Market Ecosystem Map,” mentions that today, there are more devices connected to the internet than humans, clearly indicating an upward trend. Apparently, 26 billion “things” are likely to be connected to the internet by 2020. IoT is being adopted within applications and thus being used in industries (IIoT), enterprises (smart cities and waste management), healthcare, etc. This IoT adoption is giving companies much-needed agility, efficiency, and scalability. Together, they give a competitive advantage to businesses. Luckily, there are vendors who provide a versatile IoT platform to help these companies get on the IoT bandwagon.. What is stopping us from going the IoT way?  In our earlier blog post, “Ten Reasons to Use IoT Platform-based Services” from Continuity 1, we mentioned how choosing the right vendor in a highly competitive IoT platform market was the biggest challenge for organizations. Today, we delve deeper into the subject to understand the parameters governing the same.. For starters, it’s the dearth of a sufficient budget. There’s no denying that IoT is expensive. The adoption rate is slower than it should ideally be. All you need is the right vendor who can help you upscale old infrastructure and seamlessly manage data flows. The right one will factor in inputs and needs of all concerned before offering solutions. In addition to budget, another factor that influences right vendor selection is whether to build (with someone like Continuity 1 as a platform-based service partner) or buy an off-the-shelf product.. We’ve put together six criteria you must consider if you wish to have a successful IoT journey and avoid hiccups along the way. Let’s go!. You typically begin by identifying the use cases; then you wonder what comes next. To be honest, it can get a little overwhelming if you fail to define your expected outcomes. What kind of data are you processing, which systems need to be integrated, and what kind of insights do you wish to generate? Asking these questions right away will help you arrive at the most important question: to build or to buy? To add another layer of clarity in the decision-making process, you must also critically evaluate various components individually. These would include device type, communication, cloud services, applications, and cross-layer security. . Whether or not you have the in-house expertise will influence your choices to a great extent. If the use case you have chosen involves massive amounts of data at a very fast speed, you need to be sure you are well-equipped to keep pace with evolving technologies and customer requirements. There will be components you may have to build from scratch while others can be managed with your existing solutions. It boils down to cost of ownership. Cost of ownership includes the upfront fee to procure the platform, service fee, customization charges, and the cost of upgrades to adapt to the ever-changing business dynamics. Says Kalsi, CEO of Continuity 1, “The build versus buy dilemma is always going to be there unless your decision is based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis based on the cost of ownership.”. When you choose an IoT vendor, you need to ensure it’s flexible when it comes to aligning its technologies with your legacy architecture. As such, it should not pose limitations, and it should be easier to deploy without causing any delays. A lot of vendors speak about flexibility but not all are equipped enough to offer it. Given the increasing number of devices, you’re going to require a lot of customization and personalization. On top of this, the changing business dynamics call for newer strategies and tasks. At a gross level, 90 percent of the companies pivot. Most of the times, enterprises have to change their business strategies to accommodate new business requirements. Your vendor needs to adapt to the needs of tomorrow. The problem starts when the strategies suffer due to the platform’s inability to adapt and be flexible. Bad pivots are touted as the sixth big reason why companies fail. The vendor should be able to tell you how extensible the platform is and whether there is adequate scope to add new features without disrupting the existing system. While keeping up with the technological requirements of new devices, vendors should be able to offer useful insights from the data collated so far.. There are two kinds of lock-ins that we need to consider: explicit and implicit. Explicit lock-in is where the vendor has a clause around the number of years of lock-in. The challenge is bigger when you are tied down to a specific cloud service and proprietary data protocols that are common for the device, and when cloud service prohibits you from using alternate services. This situation is commonly referred to as implicit vendor lock-in, and enterprises cringe at the thought of being stuck in this type of lock-in. Not having complete control over business applications and other related aspects, such as security, infrastructure, etc., can be scary. Even if the organization wants to migrate to another platform, it becomes very difficult, although not impossible. Enterprises aspire for the freedom to move freely from one vendor to another as required. While having everything loosely coupled may be a good idea, it may not always be possible to do so. Talk to your vendor to know the exit rules pertaining to lock-ins. Seamless migration should be the key.. As the number of connected devices continues to grow, you will start feeling the need for scalability more than ever. In fact, for most enterprises, this remains a primary concern. Costs associated with data management and hardware will continue to rise with every added device. Ask the vendor for their largest customer installations to get an idea about their scalability. As per a study done by Strategy Analytics, 35 percent of enterprises that actively used IoT had less than 100 devices connected. You need to talk to your vendor to know if they can handle the complexities that more devices bring along. The IoT platform should be armed appropriately to deal with the ever-increasing data. While the need for technological requirements may also increase, you are definitely in a good place if your vendor has perceived the growing needs of your business and made amends. When choosing your IoT vendor, this is one thing you should talk about in detail. A vendor’s agility and ability are critical. The best ones don’t rely on third parties but single-handedly offer the required functionality to scale up to your needs.. While the data analytics arena is crowded, the right vendor may be all you need to break from the pack. IoT largely rests on four main pillars: things, data, people, and processes. Through networked connections, vendors are able to understand their relationships better and deliver insights that can take businesses to a whole new level. While accessing real-time data and providing actionable insights, vendors can alert you about issues that were not even there on your radar and help make intelligent decisions. What you achieve are deeper connections and measurable business value. Not to mention operational excellence and greater agility!. Every enterprise has existing in-house or third-party tools and solutions that help them solve critical problems while adding business value. The vendor platform should be able to operate along with, and in sync with, these existing tools in an effortless manner. For a diverse assortment of sensors, actuators, and machine-learning algorithms, it’s critical that all nodes and applications share a common data model. Interoperability remains a critical aspect for a thriving IoT ecosystem. You need to ensure the IoT platform allows seamless integrations with open source tools and facilitates integration with third-party services and solutions. . The IoT ecosystem is thriving, and it will soon become the Internet of Everything. As mentioned earlier, 26 billion devices will be connected to the internet by 2020. Enterprises will need to work with these connected smart devices to accelerate their businesses effectively. While the budget and cost of ownership with a build-versus-buy aspect have been a key criterion in the decision-making process, other criteria that we discussed above are equally important, if not more. Of course, you need a vendor that’s sensitive to your needs and is willing to align their plans with your business goals. Hopefully this article will help you choose the right partners in your journey to IoT enablement. . . ",0
9,"Connected products are transforming the relationship between users and brands. Companies need to move beyond static products and find new opportunities.. Companies are in the middle of a deep transformation. The rise of new technologies, such as blockchains, machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT), unleashes exciting opportunities for business growth. Connected products are transforming the way people interact with objects and how they perceive brands, allowing companies to go beyond static products to meet the demands of today’s changing consumer.. IoT allows integration of products and services; smart connected objects with embedded sensors help companies get data, extract insights, monitor user behaviors, and improve quality. Companies need to understand how to connect objects and, most importantly of all, how to integrate their services in order to drive efficiency and profitability. As shown in a recent article from IBM, there are several ways to integrate services into products: service-for-products, service-with-products, and product-as-a-service.. Service can improve the quality and durability of products. A good example of this type of integration is smart maintenance, which is used when the maintenance service is integrated into a product that needs recurrent monitoring. This application is common in industrial machinery where a connected device can continuously send its status in the cloud in order to predict and optimize maintenance operations. Microsoft created several industrial smart maintenance products to help companies identify potential problems before the building maintenance manager even knows they exist.. Services can extend the value of products because customers are willing to pay more for products that include services. Tesla owners can update their car’s software over the air, and they don’t need a service center, as other car companies do. When updates are available, they can download the new version over WiFi, and this type of service allows the product to become safer and with enhanced capabilities over time.. Product-as-a-service is a business model that provides a service in areas that were traditionally sold as products. IBM featured a good case study showing hospital and medical facilities reducing maintenance costs by shifting their product to an “as-a-service” model.. Public buildings in the United States spend a lot of money for exit-signs maintenance; security signs need to be tested once a year and each test lasts about 20 minutes. This costs around $35/sign/year plus the cost of the single sign and installation. Thanks to IoT, it’s possible to transform the product into a service, as the building owner doesn’t have to buy the product but instead can subscribe to a service that constantly monitors the system status and carries out remote maintenance.. Before starting a digitalization process and embedding services into products, companies have to understand how to apply technology like IoT.. John Rossman, author of The Amazon Way on IoT, suggests four levels of IoT connection, where each one can activate a different type of service:. The starting level is about tracking and getting data from users. A connected device like a fitness band can tell how many hours users walk, run or sleep. These services help to visualize and manage data; companies can create awareness about the relationship between products and users’ behavior.. Connected devices receive and send data in the cloud where analytics can help to get insights, not only by collecting and visualizing data but by extracting value from past actions.. Machine learning technology can move data from insights to prediction, helping to understand a model and improving future operation, thanks to prevision systems.. Connected objects can communicate with each other and change their behavior regarding their prediction of future actions; devices are not alone but are cooperating in a system.. Digital services in products are powered by data. Data experts have moved from spending time in data preparation to spending a lot of time in data analysis. Today, we are in the Analytics 3.0 era: the era of data enriched offering. Data is embedded in products and services in order to create new opportunities.. Bosh created a so-called intelligent offering. They sell not only products but also a platform to understand people’s adoption and usage of the product. They have moved from small engine sensors to a fleet management system, from security cameras to security systems.. General Electric started to stream data from turbines, locomotives, and engines to predict maintenance and operations.. In this era, collecting information is not enough. We live with constant updates of data, and we need shortcuts to turn information into insights in order to make decisions and take action.. Data science has become the sexiest profession of the 21st century, and as they move from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, they don’t want to give advice only. Instead, they want to build things, and they describe consultancy as “the dead zone.” They cover an important role in product development, and they can accelerate improvement, because in the agile world, agile can be too slow.. Moving from products to services is no easy shift. Companies need to understand how to manage multi-channel experiences and to orchestrate an entire lineup of products integrated with digital services. In these scenarios, the amount of money the customer is willing to pay is related to the experience and not to the product feature.. In a fast-changing economy with an enormous amount of data, companies must always stay connected to customers to gain insights that improve business outcomes and, ultimately, create innovation.. The article was originally published by Luca Lamera, a UX Lead in the IoT space, here on Medium. . . ",0
10,"Choosing the right IoT vendor is challenging. Seven IoT platforms stand out as contenders for supporting smart city solutions and their associated use cases.. The IoT platform vendor market is highly competitive with many small and large players providing differentiated services. Just for an idea of how this market has grown over the five-year period, funding went from $1.2 billion in 2011 to nearly $3 billion in 2015, as per a report from CB Insights. While the competition is good since it gives choices and price advantages to the enterprises and businesses implementing or using these IoT platforms, the partner managers are challenged with decision making on which platform vendors to choose from.. A recent blog on IoT For All talked about 6 Decision-making criteria that will affect IoT platform vendor selection this year. It mentions six key decision-making criteria which any leadership team needs to mull over before selecting an IoT Platform vendor. The criteria are around the below 6 vectors.. When we look at the IoT platform vendor landscape, we must analyze which are the companies to watch out for in enterprise smart city solutions, which cover waste management, smart street lighting, energy and water metering and utility management. We can see that there are seven companies which are nimble and have a lot of relevance to the six decision-making criteria we see above.. Let’s talk about each of these seven companies and their strengths and alignments to the criteria mentioned above.. Altair provides the development platforms ‘Altaircore’ and customers can develop their own solutions on top of it. The platform has good data visualization and storage capabilities. Using Altaricore, users can have precise collaboration in analysis of data in real-time. Altairicore customers have appreciated the platform for its great usability, something critical to engage the end-users. . Enevo is a complete solution that automates the planning of waste collection and optimizes your routes. It uses patented wireless ultrasonic sensors to remotely measure the fill-level of waste containers. There’s a cloud service to forecast when bins become full and to optimize the collection routes and schedules. The drivers get guidance through the routes that get delivered to their cellular-enabled tablets. Enevo software can analyze waste patterns to reduce costs, better structure waste collections, track missed collections and increase recycling diversion rates. . Mprest has an off-the-shelf application which provides a great time to market and quality. It has good interoperability with existing toolsets and thus gives flexibility to the customer. The product is available on-prem as well as SaaS. Mprest is a complete platform that provides other smart city solutions apart from waste management. The Mprest solution has a vendor-agnostic architecture that enables integration with existing digital and smart city applications. It connects, integrates and leverages data from a myriad of sensors and systems. . Telensa is a global leader in smart street lighting solutions. It offers wireless smart city applications that help cities around the world save energy. The company provides cities and utility companies an open, low-cost platform to add multiple sensor applications. It’s a highly scalable platform with 300K+ lights supported at this point. . Gembo provides a smart city solution with great data analytics, visualization and monitoring. One can visualize statuses and KPIs at any level in the corporation. It helps city utility managers gain real-time insights into the overall effectiveness of their waste processing, power, water purifier plants, etc. It supports a large variety of utility equipment for instant time-to-big-data. . Sensus, a Xylem brand company, has an IoT smart city vertical with multiple solutions under it ranging from Advanced Metering Infrastructure, Automatic Meter Reading, Leak Management, Data Analytics, Lighting Control, etc. Sensus’s solutions collect data related to advanced metering infrastructure, automatic meter reading, billing, and consumption and assist customers on how to enhance their technologies and communication networks. The company serves a wide range of public service providers from utilities and cities to industrial complexes and campuses.. It’s generally a five-step process in vendor selection – budget allocation, business use case definition, identification of vendors, evaluation against the decision-making criteria and then partnering with the vendor.. Based on the use cases and budget, the companies can choose whichever platform vendor gives them the flexibility to pivot, scalability and the best time to market. . . ",0

Connected things are becoming pervasive among consumers and business alike. It’s hard to open a newspaper or trade magazine or watch a news channel and not see a story that is in some way related to the IoT. While giant companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon get the headlines with their cool new consumer devices, a “long tail” of commercial and industrial connected products is being rolled out today by manufacturers of all sizes. I’ve observed first hand successful new product introductions across a wide range of vertical industries and applications. These new offerings are beginning to transform sleepy and mundane industries far and wide.. Many of these concepts aren’t necessarily brand new, and some were known by different labels in the past – SCADA systems, telematics, machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. Europe has coined another related term: Industry 4.0 – literally a fourth industrial revolution.. . Real world examples. The IoT isn’t just buzzwords and abstract future concepts and promises, however. There are many concrete examples of the IoT in action today. Here are just a few areas of innovation:. There are countless more examples of new connected commercial and industrial products being developed using IoT technologies. For those manufacturers with the vision, these are exciting times.. What are the business drivers for IoT?. Along with vision, IoT projects need funding justification with a business case. I’ve observed that there are principally four main business drivers for commercial IoT projects.. Think big or small?. A straightforward and practical approach should be used when embarking on an IoT project. This should not be viewed as a massive, company-changing effort, but rather a series of small projects or digital test beds that have the potential to increase revenue, improve the bottom line or boost customer retention. While we all recognize the opportunity for success, realize that not all IoT initiatives will succeed, some say that about half will fail. If you have that in mind (failure on some trials or projects will happen) then company expectations about success are reasonable.. A reasonable approach is to pick a few products and services to which adding sensors and connecting them could possibly result in substantial improvement to the organization’s bottom line. In addition, identify three more products and services that could possibly lead to additional sources of revenue. Research has shown from a portfolio of six projects, one will be a big success, two will be average hits and three will fail.. This approach is manageable and if the pilots are successful, they can be part of the company’s offerings. If they don’t succeed, they can be considered useful learning experiments; continue and iterate on the others. This process should be repeated. When implementing, one should consider the organizational culture, ensure buy-in from the top management team, identify digital directors, transform your company culture, etc. Even with all necessary systems and processes in place, a strategy can be crushed by old visions of what the company is or aspires to be.. Summary. The industrial IoT is real. It’s here today and it’s available to anyone. It offers manufacturers large and small ways to reimagine their business and tap market opportunities.. IoT-related technology costs have fallen steadily, enabling access for smaller industrial companies that passed on earlier M2M or telematics technologies. An exciting list of new and innovative connected products are being introduced across a wide range of industries today, and not just by blue chip titans. Business cases and business models are emerging right now. However, understanding the pieces of IoT technology is critical to minimize risk and costs, and ensure success in any connected product development strategy..

12,"What is Ubuntu Core?. At first glance, Ubuntu Core seems to bear little resemblance to Ubuntu. The architecture of the Ubuntu Core operating system (OS) is completely different from traditional Ubuntu as the whole OS is made of packages called Snaps as opposed to the traditional deb packages. The image is just 200 MB, as it packages as few libraries as possible, allowing Snappy to run on platforms with as little as 500 MB of RAM. Also, installing packages via the traditional apt-get program is not possible.. But, when you look deeper, it actually has a lot of similarities. Ubuntu Core is also open source and shares a lot of code with Ubuntu. Further, all libraries you might need in your development work equally well across both platforms. So Snappy is similar, but different.. Ubuntu Core can surprise at first, as its emphasis on security and application isolation make it feel like a constrained Linux environment. That’s until you understand that Ubuntu Core is more of a production OS than a development OS – it’s the OS you want to put on a box in the middle of nowhere so that even if someone has physical access to a device they’re limited as to what they can do with it.. The Snap effect. Looking under the hood, it’s hard to understand Ubuntu Core without understanding Snaps. Snaps are a new universal Linux packaging format launched in June 2016 that have three differentiated attributes compared to traditional Ubuntu’s current packaging format.. Once the concept of Snap is clear, understanding Ubuntu Core is a breeze. Each piece of software is a Snap. All the device drivers are packaged in a kernel Snap specific to a board. The OS is a Snap with minimal libraries that sits on top of the kernel Snap. Each application is a Snap, packaging all the libraries it needs. In order to get access to resources such as networking or I/O, applications can request access to an “interface,” which is authorized by the user or the device owner.. 
[Figure 1 | The isolated architecture of “Snappy” Ubuntu Core.]. As mentioned, Ubuntu Core is not a development platform. So, how do you create these Snaps? This is where an Ubuntu Desktop (or virtual machine (VM)) becomes handy. It is possible to build, run, and test Snaps directly in familiar Ubuntu 16.04 development environment before deploying them on the device. Some devices actually offer both an Ubuntu Core and Ubuntu Desktop images to facilitate this process.. Failsafe OTA updates. One of the key features of Ubuntu Core is its transactional update mechanism, or, to put it simply, the ability to perform failsafe over the air (OTA) updates. We’ve all been through bad upgrades on a desktop, but when talking about embedded devices, those bad upgrades can become horror stories, with technicians having to be deployed in the field to fix a system that has stopped working following an update.. Therefore, many developers working with embedded devices have taken refuge in the dangerous “no upgrade” zone, but that’s becoming less and less realistic given the number of denial of service (DoS) attacks on Internet of Things (IoT) devices, government legislation, and the positive drive towards more agile embedded development, which encourages frequent updates. For this reason, Ubuntu Core offers a failsafe upgrade mechanism out of the box that ensures that systems are fully updated and operational at the end of an upgrade, and otherwise reverts back to the original software version and application data, which is particularly useful when an update also includes a database schema. While similar features are available from software vendors, having it integrated directly at the OS level makes life much more simple and also means that any piece of software on a device can be updated securely, from the kernel to the OS to the applications.. Finding balance in IoT gateways. Choosing a board for a gateway is always a tradeoff between cost, I/O, and power consumption. Finding the right balance, however, has proven more complex than ever with the number and complexity of sensors connected to gateways increasing. Is it worthwhile saving a few dollars on a cheaper processor just to be stuck with recurring cloud and connectivity fees since the local processing power is not sufficient to limit the amount of data transfer? Wherever you stand in the spectrum, there are options available.. Ubuntu Core images for the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 make it simple to launch a commercial product in just a few months, as recently demonstrated by the launch of the NextCloud Box. For more powerful options, an official image is also available for Qualcomm’s DragonBoard 410c, a 96Boards-compatible development kit that serves as the 64-bit ARMv8 architecture (arm64) reference platform for Ubuntu Core. There are also a number of community images available for a variety of other 96Boards platforms. In addition, Samsung has also made images available for its Artik 5 and 10 boards.. 
[Figure | The Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c is the official 64-bit ARMv8 reference platform for Ubuntu Core development.]. On the Intel side, the choice is just as wide, from development board to Next Unit of Computing (NUC) form factors, as well as a number of pre-configured edge gateways. Development boards like the Intel Joule and Euclid, announced at this year’s Intel Developer Forum (IDF), will run both Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core with a strong focus on robotics development. For those looking for pre-configured gateways, Canonical has announced a certification program that guarantees the gateway chosen works out of the box with Ubuntu Core, with Dell and Advantech platforms already available.. IoT development in a Snap. Ubuntu Core provides a secure and stable environment for IoT developers looking to deploy applications and features quickly, and on the hardware of choice. Snappy enables easy and cost-effective updates and maintenance of connected embedded devices, which is critical to the deployment and success of the Internet of Things..

While much of the IoT relies on the traditional embedded development skills, the requirement for always-on connectivity is tasking engineers to make decisions not only for the wireless method, but for the communications protocol, too. As a result, different protocols are trying to establish themselves as the keystone for provisioning data communication from edge nodes to the cloud. Each is vying to be seen as being the best for either certain types of data or the method by which data is exchanged.. Initially developed for use by Nest Labs within their smart thermostat and smoke detector products and acquired by Google in 2015, the Thread protocol (Figure 1) has been gaining adoption fast. With a growing partner and user community, Thread’s technical credentials make it a viable alternative to the likes of ZigBee, Z-Wave, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). One of the aspects of Thread that might account for its success is that Google has opted not to develop a completely new protocol, but base it around the established IEEE 802.15.4 wireless standard.. . [Figure 1 | The main components of the Thread protocol. Thread targets appliances, access and climate control, energy management, lighting, safety, and security. (via Thread Group)]. BLE is probably the closest rival to Thread, but BLE cannot form a self-healing mesh network, which is increasingly becoming a pre-requisite for IoT applications. Reliability is key for any form of sensor-based communication such as thermostats, security alarms, and certainly for industrial applications where safety is a vital consideration.. Despite this, BLE is certainly not out of the IoT race yet. Across all its forms, Bluetooth has benefited from progressive capability enhancements over the years and now some of the participants of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (Bluetooth SIG), such as Broadcom, Qualcomm, and other industry leaders, are working hard to improve BLE’s capabilities to make it suitable for use in IoT applications.. A good example of a highly integrated BLE SoC is Broadcom’s BCM20737 WICED SMART Bluetooth device (Figure 2), which has security features and iBeacon technology using its low-power WICED Smart chip. It includes RSA 4000-bit encryption and decryption support and includes native support for A4WP Rezence wireless charging.. . [Figure 2 | A good example of a highly-integrated BLE SoC is Broadcom’s BCM20737 WICED SMART Bluetooth device.]. The Bluetooth SIG is also paving the way for connection to the Internet. In February, it launched the Bluetooth Smart Mesh Working Group (which is already supported by more than 80 companies) with the goal of building the architecture for standardized Bluetooth mesh networking capability.. IPv6, IEEE 802.15.4, and a personal area network called IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) used by Thread, ZigBee, and Z-Wave are complementary, as the latter two were conceived expressly to serve devices with limited processing power, low data rates, very low RF output power, and minimal power consumption from either mains or battery. This should make device and network design relatively straightforward and cost-effective. 128-bit AES encryption is standard for these, and the NSA considers this method to be rated for the “Secret” clearance level since it would take a supercomputer 149 trillion years to break the code.. With Thread’s low latency (typically 100 ms and a lot less than Wi-Fi), the fact it can accommodate up to 300 devices on a network, AES 128 bit security, and a mesh networking approach positions it as an extremely capable protocol for use in IoT applications. That said, there is no evidence that Thread will become the dominant leader in IoT connectivity. With the forecast growth in IoT (Figure 3), there is clearly space for many protocols to establish themselves, perhaps carving their own niche in specific applications.. . [Figure 3 | Projected growth in wireless-enabled devices showing the exponential growth of IoT. (via BI Intelligence)]. But what about ZigBee/ZigBee Pro, Z-Wave, AllJoyn, CSR Mesh, and IoTivity?. Operating at 2.4 GHz and a maximum data rate of 250 kbps, ZigBee 3.0 has gained wide support from an estimated 400 vendors and can support thousands of nodes using a well-developed mesh networking protocol. With a link distance of about 100 feet, it supports IPv6 and offers 128-bit AES encryption security. This latest version incorporates all the former ZigBee profiles that had proliferated over the years, for which the ZigBee Alliance had been severely criticized.. Alongside ZigBee is the relatively new ZigBee Pro specification. Clearly optimised for IoT, this mesh networking protocol not only can operate in the 2.4 GHz spectrum, but also in the unlicensed ISM spectrum of 800-900 MHz. Using a frequency agile spread spectrum modulation approach, over 16 channels, it also supports multiple star topologies in addition to a broadcast transmission option. As with most IoT node applications, conserving energy is a prime consideration, so the protocol caters to those devices that do not have a battery, but harvest energy through a variety of electromechanical, light, or motion methods.. Z-Wave, meanwhile, operates exclusively in the 800-900 MHz ISM bands. With a limited range of about 100 feet, a low data rate (100 kbps) and capable of supporting up to 232 nodes, Z-Wave has still managed to gain support from over 375 organizations.. From within the Linux Foundation is the AllSeen Alliance with their AllJoyn framework. AllJoyn is an emerging open-source, collaborative software framework that allows developers to write applications for IoT regardless of brand, category, transport mediums, and operating systems without the need to use the cloud or even the Internet (both of which are supported, however). It provides support for Wi-Fi, Ethernet, serial, and power-line transmission media. Supported operating systems include RTOS, Arduino, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac. The framework uses 128-bit AES encryption and is currently supported by more than 120 companies.. Another protocol operating from within the Linux Foundation is IoTivity, which focuses on improving interoperability and defining the connectivity requirements for IoT. It uses a common communications framework to wirelessly connect and manage the flow of information among personal computing and emerging IoT devices regardless of form factor, operating system, or service provider.. With Google’s support, Thread is highly likely to thrive. Backed by a company that is embracing IoT by provisioning a host of cloud connectivity platforms, it should do well. However, there are many other cloud service providers that are growing by the day. While few of them can compete on size, they do provide plenty of opportunities for other protocols to gain significant share in the future..

14,"Digital certificates, such as X.509 used by the transport layer security (TLS) protocol, are ingrained in almost every aspect of our digital lives. Whether sending a secure e-mail, checking a bank account balance, or performing any other action that requires an encrypted online connection, these certificates authenticate the identity of parties involved in the electronic exchange of information to prevent, for example, man-in-the-middle attacks whereby a malicious actor impersonates one entity and potentially alters or misrepresents the content being exchanged.. Certificate authorities (CAs) sign digital certificates as proof that they have validated a root certificate containing an entity’s public key, which is mathematically associated with a unique private key that remains secret as part of an entity’s asymmetric public/private key pair (Figure 1). This key exchange and verification mechanism between user and CA instills confidence in any recipient of the digital certificate that its sender is in fact who they attest to be.. . . [Figures 1a and 1b | As shown in Figure 1A, digital certificates are generated by certificate authorities (CAs) who sign off on the public key of entities attempting to establish secure online connections (Figure 1B).]. However, outside of the enterprise/IT community digital certificates have primarily been used to validate servers only. Client authentication is typically not implemented in most applications because it requires certificate provisioning for large sets of heterogeneous end users, which complicates the management of a public key infrastructure (PKI). But with the Internet of Things (IoT) introducing billions of clients that not only retrieve information from the cloud but also send data to it, the requirement for mutual authentication – or the immediate two-way authentication of both clients and servers – has steadily increased to ensure overall system integrity.. AWS, mutual authentication, and Just-In-Time Registration. With the release of the AWS IoT platform last year, Amazon Web Services (AWS) introduced mutual authentication to the IoT space. As mentioned, mutual authentication technology helps verify the integrity of all parties in a system of systems architecture, but also introduces problems related to certificate provisioning for client-side devices.. In response, AWS released a service this April called “Use Your Own Certificate,” which allows original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to register digital certificates signed by a third-party CA with the AWS IoT platform using an API. The Use Your Own Certificate feature implies that the key exchange required for the creation of a digital certificate can occur independent of a client connection with AWS IoT servers, and perhaps even before the device itself is connected to the Internet, introducing a new possibility for OEMs: Unique cryptographic keys can be generated for each device during production, signed by a CA as part of an offline digital certificate verification process, and then loaded into the AWS IoT platform to await a service request from systems containing the corresponding key pairs. This process also lays the groundwork for the latest capability in the AWS IoT portfolio, Just-In-Time Registration (JITR), announced in August.. JITR is somewhat of a turning point for the IoT in that, as the term implies, devices can automatically connect to and be recognized by the AWS IoT cloud the first time they request service from the platform. This type of immediate, autonomous onboarding of devices with cloud services is critical given the projected number of IoT connections, but is contingent upon the devices connecting being pre-equipped with unique, trusted private keys in order to enable services such as the Use Your Own Certificate API and to prevent impersonation attacks (Figure 2). It also requires that devices be equipped with the correct server configurations and policies to help facilitate the onboarding process, which must also be kept secure.. . [Figure 2 | Just-in-time registration (JITR) allows devices to connect with AWS IoT servers the first time they attempt a service connection, but requires that the Use Your Own Certificate API be leveraged first to upload device certificates into AWS IoT.]. The challenge of device manufacturers is to ensure that these keys and policies remain secret and secure from the time a device is manufactured, through the onboarding process, and even after a product reaches end of life (EOL). Previously this has been attempted through the installation of hardware security modules (HSMs) in secure rooms at factories, periodic factory security audits, and time box protocols that attempt to define an acceptable onboarding period for devices. Unfortunately, these methods tend to be either expensive or inexact, and also don’t account for threats that could compromise systems deployed in the field, such as physical tampering.. Hardware-based elliptic curve cryptography anchors trust in IoT. 2016 has also seen significant news from the other side of the IoT technology spectrum, as semiconductor vendor Microchip acquired competitor Atmel for approximately $3.6 billion earlier this year. Among other technologies, the purchase netted Microchip access to Atmel’s portfolio of security ICs, including elliptic curve cryptography-based (ECC-based) CryptoAuthentication devices such as the ECC508A (Figure 3).. . [Figure 3 | The ECC508A is a 2 mm x 3 mm tamper-resistant CryptoAuthentication device based on elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) cryptography algorithms that provide hardware-based cryptographic key generation, storage, and countermeasures.]. The ECC508A is noteworthy in the framework of AWS IoT’s mutual authentication, Use Your Own Certificate, and JITR capabilities in that the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement protocol it employs enables the internal generation and storage of private keys. These keys remain protected through the life of the device due to tamper-resistant architectural features of the chip, including internally encrypted memory, isolated power rails, a memory and logic shield, internal clock generation, and a lack of probe points that protect against real-world threats such as emissions analysis, microprobe, power cycling, and timing attacks. This secure storage space can also be used to house pre-configured AWS server policies, resulting in a device that contains all of the information needed for digital certificate authentication and onboarding required by JITR.. As seen in wolfSSL’s wolfCrypt benchmark of an embedded SSL/TLS stack running on the ECC508A, the hardware-based crypto acceleration of the chip also offloads encryption tasks from a host processor, resulting in improved overall system performance (Figure 4).. . [Figure 4 | The wolfCrypt ECC benchmark shown here illustrates performance metrics of a TLS transaction running the lightweight (20 Kb – 100 Kb) wolfSSL embedded SSL/TLS library on the ECC508A hardware-based crypto accelerator versus in software. The average TLS establishment time for the ECC508A is 2.342 seconds, compared to 13.422 seconds in software, good enough for a 5.73x improvement. Graph courtesy wolfSSL.]. ECC508A and AWS IoT: The process. As discussed previously, private keys are mathematically correlated with the public keys required for the creation of digital certificates. Therefore the ECC508A becomes the root of trust for any device that equips it.. In the context of a mutually authenticated AWS IoT deployment leveraging the ECC508A, Microchip can act as the CA, both generating and signing device certificates in parallel as part of the certificate chain verification process for an IoT OEM. The OEM would then load the resulting digital certificates into their AWS IoT account through the Use Your Own Certificate API, where they would remain until an incoming TLS request from a device containing the partnered ECC508A key pair triggers the JITR process.. The procedure, from key generation through cloud onboarding, requires a one-time setup, shown in Figure 5. As keys are generated in a secure Microchip facility and the key management infrastructure is already in place, OEMs are able to access robust security and automatic cloud authentication by adding a single component to their bill of materials (BoM).. . [Figure 5 | With the ECC508A acting as the root of trust, Microchip can act as a third-party CA, signing device certificates in an offline verification process and providing them to an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for upload to an AWS IoT account.]. Dropping anchor on IoT security. Security is essential to the continued rollout of IoT in every market, and discrete solutions that allow device makers to separate security from business functions and value adds will enable more innovative products in the future. An ECC508A evaluation kit is available for interested parties through Microchip and distributors such as DigiKey and Mouser, with trials and tutorials of AWS IoT accessible at aws.amazon.com/iot.. .

15,"Recently, some of the projections on IoT device deployments have been revised downward from their initial (gaudy) numbers. Why is that?. LI: There’s no reason to worry about the downward revision for IoT. The expectations for this industry in terms of market penetration are much too high right now. It feels like the IoT is being compared to the smartphone revolution, where there would be one or a few killer devices like the iPhone.. Although IoT is the next big thing, the environment is so much different. I don’t think that IoT is going to produce a killer device. There is so much variety. It’s more like there will be 99 IoT products scattered around your home, from wearables to various smart home devices. I always think about electronics and how many types of devices and machines have been created around this revolution. It’s similar with IoT devices: there will be a lot of players and not many killer products, but maybe an intelligent centralized service or system.. Wearables and the smart home account for perhaps two of the most overhyped IoT markets, with the smart home in particular lagging behind predictions. What needs to occur in these (and other markets) to advance to more developed stages of the IoT?. LI: What needs to occur in these two markets, and actually the entire IoT ecosystem, is to produce commonly agreed upon standards and protocols in areas of data, human-machine interfaces (HMIs), knowledge, and service interoperability. In markets like the smart home and wearables, data continuity and consistency are problem areas. It’s not easy to transfer data from one device to another from a different manufacturer, or even user preferences from one system to another. All your IoT devices in your home might not be compatible to control or exchange information for higher level offerings. There also needs to be consistency in certain features and, beyond that, standards on consumer data privacy and security. Right now people are just warming up to the idea of IoT. It’s still in the early stages and focused on physical connectivity, or Internet-connected things.. Does the strategy for advancing the consumer IoT differ from the Industrial IoT? If so, how?. LI: Yes. First, you are not going to have the large quantities of devices in Industrial IoT compared to the consumer market. Second, industrial IoT is a controlled and regulated environment. Think of applications for manufacturing processes: there are specific actions to do things, meaning there is an explicit purpose for the sensors and the data. It’s easier than trying to interpret consumer behavior. Consumer IoT has so many variables and so much more variety regarding types of services that companies can roll out.. Given all this, when do you think the IoT as a whole will reach critical mass?. LI: Many connected IoT devices are making their way into the home already. Even 10 years ago, home security system providers provided sensors for your doors and windows.. It’s hard to really predict when IoT will reach critical mass, but I foresee that there will be more connected devices in most homes in three years. I mean, most devices now have a processor. In five years, I think we’ll see many of these devices be connected at different layers – not just at the physical connectivity layer. When devices can communicate and work together as a whole system and service, you’ll see growing value from those sensors and connected devices and data – but we can’t get there without the right standards in place..

16,"This website collects personal data and uses cookies to improve services. By using this site, you agree to our Privacy Policy.. In-field firmware updates are an increasingly popular feature in microcontroller-based (MCU-based) applications. These updates enable new firmware images to be downloaded onto a device’s memory, providing an effective way for product manufacturers to offer services and support to products that are already deployed in the field. The Internet of Things (IoT) era is driving increased connectivity in the embedded world, making this one of the most crucial features for today’s connected products, so long as they are secure.. IoT developers often consider faster time-to-market and lower product maintenance costs when deploying firmware update mechanisms, as the capability allows them to stage feature roll-outs, enable/disable features or functionality on devices in the field, fix firmware bugs after a product has been released, reduce the need for expensive technical support, and enable better overall end user experiences. However, if proper security measures are not in place, this feature may be misused and the consequences of a successful exploitation can be disastrous, ranging from intellectual property (IP) theft and product cloning all the way to unauthorized control of the deployed system. For example, a successful exploitation of firmware update mechanisms that do not support verifying a new firmware image’s authenticity in a hospital drug pump can lead to a hacker tampering with the dosages of drugs delivered to patients.. Firmware updates and their vulnerabilities. Figure 1 shows a typical firmware update process. The steps include:. . [Figure 1 | Shown here is a typical firmware update process.]. 
In Figure 1 potential security threats are apparent during the “transport” phase when new firmware is transferred via an untrusted communication channel, or during the “firmware loading” phase when the new firmware is downloaded onto the device in the field.. The new firmware image being downloaded to the device corresponds to the IP of the product manufacturer and the target asset. Threats to this asset include:. It is evident that the aforementioned threats can have disastrous consequences for the product manufacturer, service provider, and end user, thus indicating an intense need for embedded designers to strongly consider measures that increase the overall security of the firmware update mechanism. . Secure firmware update considerations for design engineers. Figure 2 shows an example representation of network-connected systems. In this case, the new firmware image is transferred either from the product manufacturer (e.g., a new feature roll-out or firmware bug fix) or the service provider (e.g., to enable/disable features or services in a product) to the end nodes over local or wide area networks (LANs/WANs), and may involve authentication from end user applications (e.g., via mobile devices and web applications) to perform the firmware update. . . [Figure 2 | A secure firmware update includes security measures dictated by the interface protocols used for network communications, as well as application-level security that ensures firmware images are secured before data enters the network.]. Embedded systems engineers designing firmware update capabilities for IoT systems need to not only understand the assets that need to be protected and the potential threats, but also the capabilities and limitations of their system, especially as they pertain to cost, performance, or power consumption in constrained systems. As a starting point, an effective security solution that incorporates the right combination of cryptographic algorithms and protocol-level measures must be considered.. Cryptographic algorithms provide a means of protecting the privacy of content while ensuring its authenticity and integrity. Not all cryptographic algorithms are the same, but they are based on four cryptographic primitives that handle one or more components of the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity (CIA) triad. These primitives are: . Encryption and decryption: Encryption is the process by which data (plaintext) is transformed into something random and meaningless (ciphertext), while decryption performs the opposite job. These primitives provide both confidentiality and authenticity, and are used to prevent the reverse engineering of firmware.. One-way functions: Functions such as hash are mathematical algorithms that are easy to calculate in one direction but difficult in the other. They are used to obtain a digital “fingerprint” that ensures the integrity of firmware before it is transported into the field.. Digital signatures: Used to detect if a message was altered after it was signed, thus providing not only integrity but also authentication. These make use of public-key cryptography to generate a signature that can only be properly decrypted using the manufacturer’s public key.. Message authentication code (MAC): Similar to a digital signature except that it uses symmetric keys to encrypt and decrypt a hash generated by the manufacturer. If the hash value decrypted by the receiver matches the hash value calculated for the message, then the message is valid. In this way, MACs provide both authenticity and integrity.. 
Some factors that influence the selection of cryptographic algorithms include performance requirements, the security needs of the system, memory footprint, energy consumption, and reliability and acceptance of the algorithm by the security community (such as organizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)).. In addition to cryptographic algorithms, protocol-level measures against threats such as firmware downgrading should be considered. As mentioned previously, firmware downgrading is an attack in which an older defective firmware image (encrypted or not) is re-sent to a device in order to revert it to a vulnerable state. A version check of both the firmware and keys can ensure that only new versions are programmed during an update. . An attacker can also interrupt a firmware update process using several methods (power loss, physical connection failure, bits flipped during transmission, etc.). This can lead to a device executing an incomplete or invalid firmware image, rendering it useless or in a compromised state. In order to address this scenario, firmware update mechanisms need to ensure that an incomplete or corrupted image is not executed, and if necessary, should revert the system to a valid, previously used image. . Cryptographic bootloaders for connected embedded systems. Firmware updates are typically handled by the device bootloader. A bootloader is a piece of code that resides on device memory and has the ability to reprogram the application memory space. However, finding or creating an embedded bootloader with the security required for network-connected systems can be challenging. For example, a system may need the ability to update cryptographic keys, so cryptographic functions and a bootloader protocol should support upgrading keys and increased network security during the firmware update process. The bootloader protocol should also accommodate verifying firmware update versions and packet tracking to check if all packets of a specific firmware update image were received. . As discussed, the selection of a cryptographic algorithm is critical because it not only sets the level of security of the system, but it also impacts its performance, memory footprint, and power consumption. With this in mind, AES-CCM represents an optimal solution for embedded bootloaders. AES-CCM is a cryptographic bootloader (Crypto-Bootloader) built on two cryptographic primitives: AES Counter Mode (AES-CTR) for encryption and cipher block chaining message authentication code (CBC-MAC) for integrity and authenticity verification. Due to the low overhead provided by AES-CCM, it provides a perfect balance between increased security and low memory footprint, high throughput, and efficient power consumption (Figure 3).. . [Figure 3 | The AES-CCM algorithm is used to encrypt firmware data such as the firmware version number, packet number, and total number of packets. This information is fed into the algorithm along with a symmetric data encryption key to encrypt the data and generate an encrypted MAC tag, which represent part of Texas Instruments’ Crypto-Bootloader core command.]. The selection of an MCU implementing the bootloader should not be overlooked, either. Designers should consider MCUs with features like hardware encryption engines, a memory protection unit (MPU), low-power peripherals, and memory technologies that allow fast read/write cycles for increased throughput. The MSP430FR5969 MCU from Texas Instruments is an example of such an MCU that integrates an AES-256 co-processor to accelerate encryption algorithms, MPU and MPU-IP encapsulation (MPU-IPE) modules to enable increased protection and encapsulation of memory regions, as well as up to 64 KB of FRAM memory for high performance and ultra-low power consumption. The Crypto-Bootloader solution implemented on MSP430FR5969 devices encapsulates most of the security features and considerations outlined here (Figure 4).. . [Figure 4 | MSP430FR5969 MCUs integrate a Crypto-Bootloader, as well as MPU/MPU-IPE modules and an AES-256 security co-processor.]. Securing firmware for the Internet of Things. In summary, increasingly network embedded products are creating the potential for advanced security threats, making in-field firmware updates more vulnerable to remote attacks and exploitations. Therefore, it is important for embedded designers to consider securing their firmware update mechanisms through solutions that provide the right level of security while balancing the cost, power, and performance constraints of IoT products..

ARM’s new 32-bit ARMv8-M architecture was introduced in 2015, adding TrustZone security extensions for Cortex-M microcontrollers (MCUs), among other features. As v8-M-based silicon comes to market, it’s essential that developers understand the architecture, the new capabilities it offers, and how to implement it in the design of connected edge devices that form the foundation of secure end-to-end systems.. Internet of Things (IoT) security issues often result from inadequate protection for devices at the edge of a connected system. These tend to be low power, cheap microcontroller-based devices that perform a single function, like temperature monitoring. Lack of processing power, memory, and, of course, cost, are often cited as reasons for not being able to properly secure these assets, which are increasingly being exploited by hackers as trampolines to higher value assets connected to the same network. In order to protect intellectual property, customer data, user safety, and brand reputation against such threats, device makers have investigated a variety of techniques to secure vulnerable endpoints, including the use of multiple MCUs with one or more dedicated solely to performing security functions such as encryption and authentication. This of course raises complexity, cost, and adds another line item to a bill of materials (BOM).. Fortunately, however, that is set to change for MCU-based devices. In 2015 ARM announced that its hardware-based security technology, TrustZone, would be available on Cortex-M MCUs by virtue of the new v8-M architecture. With security capabilities akin to what has been widely deployed across Cortex-A application procesors, ARMv8-M brings foundational security to Cortex-M devices and enables the creation of IoT systems that are secure from end to end.. TrustZone extensions for ARMv8-M: Enhanced security architecture. The ARMv8-M architecture is a 32-bit architecture that maintains compatibility with ARMv6-M and ARMv7-M to ease software migration within the Cortex-M family, while also incorporating a host of enhancements and new capabilities, most notably in the way of security. The security enhancements include improvements to the Protected Memory System Architecture and the aforementioned inclusion of TrustZone security extensions, the latter of which allows secure and non-secure states to be established so that multiple security domains can exist within a single Cortex-M device.. System on chips (SoCs) often include multiple microprocessors, each assigned to offload system management or other tasks (I/O for example). In this architecture, one processor typically operates in a privileged state and the other in non-privileged state. While MCU-based systems have also had the ability to establish privileged and unprivileged states via the use of memory protection units (MPUs) or memory management units (MMUs) for some time, the v8-M TrustZone extensions provide an additional level of security and more efficient resource utilization, which reduces system design complexity and thereby cost.. How it works. Conceptually, TrustZone for v8-M works similar to TrustZone for Cortex-A processors. Unlike TrustZone technology for Cortex-A-class processors, however, there is no Secure Monitor to manage transitions between the two states. Instead, the secure and non-secure states are memory map based, which eliminates switching overhead and effectively fulfills the energy efficiency requirements of edge devices (Figure 1).. 
[Figure 1 | TrustZone extensions for ARMv8-M removes the Secure Monitor for more efficient switching between secure and non-secure states in resource-constrained Cortex-M processors.]. With TrustZone extensions for v8-M, the definition of secure and non-secure regions in an MCU is at the discretion of the chip designer. This is done using a new capability called the Secure Attribution Unit (SAU), a software technology that is used to define secure and non-secure memory regions. Alternatively, device- or system-specific controller logic tied to a special Implementation Defined Attribution Unit (IDAU) interface to the processor can be used accomplish the same. They key difference between the two is that the SAU is programmable in secure states, whereas the IDAU creates a fixed memory map.. The processor state depends on which memory region (secure or non-secure) is accessed. The processor state is secure if code is running in the secure memory region, and, similar to traditional TrustZone technology, code executing in the secure memory region has access to the non-secure region but not the other way around. However, TrustZone for v8-M introduces an additional memory type within the secure region called a Non-secure Callable (NSC) that acts as an entry point for code running in the non-secure memory region to access services, functions, or data in the secure region. Thus, the NSC portion of memory adds a degree of separation between secure and non-secure memory regions while facilitating access to secure functions. Application developers who need to use NSC memory must do so using a new instruction introduced in the v8 architecture called the Secure Gateway (SG). The SG instruction must reside in NSC memory and must be the first instruction in the API to access secure functions. Any attempt to access secure memory without a valid SG instruction leads to a hard fault.. In addition, ARM has also enhanced AHB-Lite that was defined as part of the AMBA 3.0 interconnect specification. Now AMBA 5 AHB5, the updated specification adds a special instruction to flag secure and non-secure bus transactions, permitting systems with TrustZone for ARM v8-M to interoperate with TrustZone on Cortex-A devices. This feature is essential for enablement design scalability and end-to-end, system-wide security.. Edge protection scenarios. There are a number of security applications are enabled by the new TrustZone extensions for ARMv8-M, including:. IP protection: Intellectual property, such as proprietary algorithms, relate directly to a company’s intrinsic value. Device makers can use TrustZone for ARMv8-M to store intellectual property in secure memory while still allowing non-secure applications to access it via APIs.. Secure storage of critical information: Keeping user data, identity information, and security keys separate from the rest of the system ensures confidentiality.. Root of trust implementation: A root of trust implementation provides a secure foundation for many different applications, such as secure over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates. Such a basis of trust is also critical to enabling mutual authentication between devices in a system.. Sandboxing of certified software: Software certification is an expensive process. Using certified software for cryptography, for example, allows device makers to enter new markets where such requirements are mandated. TrustZone for ARMv8-M allows keeping such code in secure memory regions while allowing access to applications via APIs in NSC memory regions.. Reducing cost via processor consolidation: In complex SoCs where one processor may be dedicated to performing security functions, TrustZone for ARMv8-M makes it possible to implement the same security capabilities as would be performed by the dedicated processor, thereby reducing cost and complexity.. End-to-end security example. Let’s take a simple door lock example to demonstrate the usefulness of TrustZone for ARM v8-M in achieving end-to-end security. There are four parts to this system – a door lock, a Cortex-M MCU based camera unit with TrustZone extensions for ARMv8-M that controls the lock, a Cortex-A microprocessor-based gateway with TrustZone technology, and a smartphone. When someone comes to the door, the camera takes an image and sends it to the gateway, which relays the image to a mobile phone app. Upon viewing the image, the user clicks a button in the app to open the door.. In this example, the edge node gains its root of trust from TrustZone for ARMv8-M, which becomes the basis for authenticating itself to the gateway. The gateway also authenticates itself to the mobile phone via TrustZone on the Cortex-A MPU. When the user selects the “open door” command on their phone, the phone relays it to the gateway, which in turn relays it to the edge node to open the door. Commands relayed between devices are validated at each step as part of the process, ensuring system-wide integrity (Figure 2).. 
[Figure 2 | TrustZone extensions for ARMv8-M enable the creation of secure IoT systems with integrity validated at each level of the design.]. TrustZone for ARMv8-M supports energy-conscious devices like wearables or battery-operated edge nodes in markets such as smart utilities and smart cities. Not only do the TrustZone extensions make it possible to secure the edge, but they change security economics by reducing complexity and eliminating additional parts dedicated to performing security functions. While TrustZone for ARMv8-M-capable silicon has yet to hit the market, several software companies – including Express Logic, Green Hills Software, IAR Systems, IBM, Mentor Graphics, Micrium, Real-Time Engineers, Symantec, and Trustonic – have announced their intentions to support it.. Ultimately, the choice to leverage the capabilities of ARMv8-M lies with device makers, as TrustZone for v8-M will require that developers change application development practices. Using TrustZone for ARMv8-M enforces disciplined thinking about what information needs to be protected, and will likely result in short-term learning curves that could impact the development process. But weighed against the cost of releasing insecure products, the decision is a simple one – TrustZone for ARMv8-M fills an immediate gap in the path towards system-wide security for the IoT..

As Internet of Things (IoT) concepts took hold and started to become realities a few years back, one of the first challenges realized was interoperability between wireless protocols. Different vertical markets and applications often employ different protocols tailored to the specific use case. Some of these protocols have been standardized; others have not. In all, the result has been extreme market fragmentation around wireless connectivity, as well as a great deal of confusion in the developer community as far as which technology to bet on.. Short-range wireless for the smart home is a good example of the overload of options available to device manufacturers, as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Insteon, X10, ZigBee, Thread, and Z-Wave (and to some extent, Wi-Fi) are just a few of the technologies competing to become the standard of choice for connecting home automation devices. These protocols generally have a low data rate and transmission range, and, as such, those that employ a mesh network topology have emerged as favorites to fit the power efficiency and coverage area requirements of the smart home. Bluetooth will soon join Insteon, Thread, ZigBee, and Z-Wave as short-range wireless protocols that can claim the mesh networking distinction, with each vying for enough market share to drive the others out of the home automation space.. But with so many similarities between them (see Figure 1), how does one technology rise above the rest? For the Z-Wave Alliance, the answer is through openness.. . Advancing connectivity through the public domain. The Z-Wave transport layer protocol was developed in the middle part of the last decade, with the technology’s formal governing body, the Z-Wave Alliance, being established in 2005. Since that time, Z-Wave representatives estimate that more than 50 million products based on the technology have permeated the smart home arena, yielding an approximate 70 percent market share.. In an effort to maintain that pace in everything from security systems and connected door locks to smart thermostats and sprinkler systems, Sigma Designs (the owner of Z-Wave IP) donated the Z-Wave MAC/PHY to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which is now globally standardized as ITU 9959 radio. This marked the first step in making Z-Wave more accessible to IoT developers, with the second being the recent release of the Z-Wave Interoperability Specification, Z-Wave Security Specification (S2), and the API specifications for Z-Wave over IP (Z/IP Gateway) and Z-Wave Middleware (Z-Ware) into the public domain. Together these assets make up the Z-Wave Public Specification, which is available free of charge and sans licenses.. While the Interoperability Spec release is designed to drive more interaction between Z-Wave and device makers and opening up security specifications has become common practice these days to get more eyes on potential vulnerabilities, the most important portions of the announcement may be the Z/IP Gateway and Z-Ware APIs, which can be leveraged to link Z-Wave meshes to upstream IP networks and create higher level Z-Wave over IP applications, respectively. The hope is these technologies will help Z-Wave become more integrated with frameworks such as the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) and cloud platforms such as AWS, and SD images have been made available for the Raspberry Pi so that developers working at the gateway level can get started easily.. Technology tweaks and dealing with deep pockets. While the above moves represent a significant play for smart home standardization, Z-Wave faces a long road in the battle for the smart home as the pervasive BLE sets its sights on traditional Z-Wave applications, and deep-pocketed members of Thread such as Google, Samsung, and ARM continue to push the 802.15.4. But Raoul Wijgergangs, Vice President Z-Wave Business Unit at Sigma Designs, believes that that the reduced noise and greater coverage area provided by the 900 MHz band, as well as power efficiency built into the protocol, will keep Z-Wave in its leading smart home position for the foreseeable future.. “We are competing with them, but the biggest volumes of the smart home market can be seen in the service provider area,” Wijgergangs says. “Security companies represent the biggest driver of volume, followed by the telcos and cable companies, and only then comes the small portion of retail and do-it-yourself, and that portion is probably only 20 percent of the market.. “In order to get UL certification for home security you need to be able to do jamming detect,” he continues. “If there is an intruder in your yard that is transmitting a certain amount of signal you can detect that is going on and an alarm panel will alert the security service provider. You can do this both in 2.4 GHz and 900 MHz, however, in 2.4 GHz there is continuously so much going on in that band, whether it is a Netflix video stream or Bluetooth audio streaming, all of those streams for a jamming detect system look like the system is being jammed so it will generate a lot of false positives to the security service provider. So, for [the 2.4 GHz technologies] it is practically impossible to do true security sensors. It basically cuts them out, because of radio choices, from good portions of the ecosystem play.. “Apart from that, being very power efficient is something that is both chip related and built into your protocol and mesh network is very important. To take IP packets all the way into end nodes that are battery operated, with a good level of security on top of it, will basically reduce your battery life between a factor of 8 and 10. That’s what Thread is doing, for example,” Wijgergangs says.. Time and technology tweaks will ultimately decide which wireless protocol secures itself as a standard for the smart home, but for developers, the more open these solutions become, the better..  .

The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises to deliver a step change in efficiency and a leap towards autonomy for industrial automation and other sectors, such as security and surveillance and building management. The prospect of self-monitoring, self-managing factories and manufacturing processes is no longer beyond the distant horizon. The ability to remotely identify, monitor, and control every individual device on a manufacturing process network with minimal or no human intervention offers opportunities that were beyond comprehension just a decade ago – even in the eyes of engineers working at the very forefront of industrial manufacturing technology. At the core of achieving the IIoT’s true potential will be the effective interplay and connection of sensing, computing, and control technologies in robust, energy-efficient implementations.. Successful IIoT design and management can mean continuously optimized efficiency, reduced operating costs, and more resilient self-learning processes. At the fulcrum of this are a number of semiconductor technologies on offer and in development at some of the world’s top electronic component manufacturers.. The key drivers in the IIoT are more measurement of an expanding number of parameters, fast and extensive analysis of and reactions to data, and accelerated enhancements to processes.. Vision-based sensing and energy harvesting. Sensors are at the heart of the IIoT, gathering more and more data. But to measure more, we need to sense more – more parameters, more accurately, and more often. Overlaying software on established technologies can bring incremental gains, but to make the necessary advances we need to add more parameters with accuracy. Each additional parameter can make the system smarter.. Sensor technology to measure “traditional” parameters, such as temperature, light, position, level, humidity, and pressure, continues to advance. But despite becoming smaller, more cost-effective, and often embedded, each sensor is dedicated and, hence, limited in its functionality and versatility. Vision-based sensing enables a new paradigm. Corollary to the concept of “a picture is worth a thousand words,” once a machine can “see,” much more is possible much faster.. With vision sensing, programmability brings flexibility, enabling a single vision system to sense missing or misplaced components and other process variables. The trend towards vision-based sensing – both still and video – will make future systems more intelligent, flexible, and ultimately more valuable.. Current advances in machine vision, in many situations, can provide better sight than the human eye. Coupled with the reduction in risks associated with human error, it enables a new degree of adaptability and speed for reconfigurable production processes. This could be anything from optimization based on real-time events to the reconfiguration of a system that may allow multiple products to be made on a single line. They only require a simple change from one control program to the next and the system is ready to run. This has obvious cost, time, and labor benefits and reduces the risks associated with error.. However, the distributed nature of the IIoT and the requirement to place multiple sensors at the various points of measurement presents another challenge: the reliable delivery of power.. Successful sensors, especially those utilized in IIoT designs, have four basic attributes: they need to be self-powered, collect data, broadcast their status, and have the ability to connect. Wireless sensors with the ability to harvest energy, i.e. self-powered, are essential if the IIoT is to advance and realize its potential. ON Semiconductor’s energy harvesting, wireless Smart Passive Sensor family, as shown in Figure 1, provides an example of the technology that can meet these requirements. These devices can be used to sense in the most hard to access, space constrained places with no direct power source.. 


. [Figure 1 | ON Semiconductor’s Smart Passive Sensor family are wireless and self-powered]. Being able to harvest power will allow sensors to function autonomously.. Instant access to data. Sensors gather data, and then post-processing and analytics generate valuable information, along with the ability to control our factories and processes.. The processing of large, sustained flows of data associated with real-time sensing for the IIoT is reliant on the cloud. This analysis requires platforms that can store large data sets across distributed clusters; often combining and processing data from many geographically dispersed sources.. Among the many benefits the cloud brings is the removal of barriers in global organizations. For example, a problem in a Chinese smart factory can trigger an almost instantaneous process improvement in a similar factory located somewhere else in the world.. Advances in secure communications and authentication allow mobile devices to connect into these networks, bringing opportunities for instantaneous access to information. Flexible access can then drive value into the business and its relationships with the outside world. In fact, this IT/Operational Technology (OT) integration, as shown in Figure 2, has the potential to bring the greatest benefits to a broad range of industrial-automation applications.. 



. [Figure 2 | IT/OT integration]. Reacting to analyzed data. Many industrial control systems are very sophisticated and require accurate or careful, often rapid, positioning. This could mean anything from the speed and direction of a cooling fan, to a motor or servo that adjusts a valve position, or a stepper motor for linear or angular positioning in a precision task.. Alongside the rapid development of sensing for the IIoT, the actuators and their controllers that provide the physical reactions to gathered, analyzed data are seeing similar advancements. Discrete, component based solutions for motor control are being superseded by advanced integrated power modules that are smaller and more straightforward to implement.. Combining sensing, connectivity, and actuation. Integrated manufacturing processes require a broad range of sensing technologies to be combined with connectivity and actuation, which creates design and expertise challenges. Fully integrated hardware and software development platforms that combine these elements are crucial to help speed and ease the customization of specific functions for adoption into end products. Modularity makes these platforms extensible to new IoT/IIoT functions and devices that are based on new advances, allowing more rapid adoption. Open-source support is also important, since a broad ecosystem and interoperability are crucial for the IoT’s success.. Vision sensing is a good example. From a hardware perspective, this requires video processing capability to implement, as well as image-processing software to interpret the data stream. Similarly, data gathered from energy harvesting wireless sensors must be able to be moved to the cloud (see Figure 3).. [Figure 3 | ON Semiconductor’s IoT Development Kit for Smart Passive sensors allows the movement of sensor data to the cloud for applications development]. Sensors, data processing, and actuators are all significant building blocks of an IIoT application. However, without a means to communicate, share data, and transmit, receive and execute instructions, the IIoT cannot function.. Considering the IIoT’s unique requirements, not all standards and protocols are satisfactory. The technologies suitable for smartphone PANs or single-supplier standards are unlikely to be successful. Instead, it’s important for IIoT platforms to demonstrate flexibility by supporting a broad array of standards, including Thread, SIGFOX, EnOcean, M-BUS, KNX, ZigBee, and proprietary protocols. The adoption of a software-defined radio approach allows a single platform to support multiple protocols. ZigBee and Thread are complementary, and the alliance of the industry organizations behind these protocols should also drive broad adoption within smart home applications.. Thread is an IP-based (IPv6) networking protocol built on open standards for low-power 802.15.4 mesh networks that can easily and securely connect hundreds of devices to each other and directly to the cloud. Security and interoperability are two of Thread’s key value-added capabilities.. Conversely, SIGFOX enables wide-area networks that provide relatively low bandwidth communication with fixed or mobile smart objects or sensors that are deployed over a large area. Example applications for this protocol include the nationwide tracking of shipping containers or vehicles, and communication with geographically spread assets such as smart-city equipment or oil pumps and pipelines..

As silicon geometries approach the edge of physics, a new rule of thumb is poised to govern the computing industry: “Thou shalt reduce power consumption by 50 percent every two years.” How could that be possible? Sub-threshold voltage circuitry.. The ULPBench is a standardized benchmark developed by the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium (EEMBC) for measuring the energy efficiency of ultra-low power (ULP) embedded microcontrollers (MCUs). The benchmark ports a normalized set of MCU workloads to a target, such as memory and math operations, sorting, and GPIO interaction. These workloads form the basis for analyzing the active and low-power conditions of 8-, 16-, or 32-bit MCUs, including active current, sleep current, core efficiency, cache efficiency, and wake-up time. The results are then calculated using a reciprocal formula (1000/Median of 5 times average energy per second for 10 ULPBench cycles), yielding a score based on the amount of energy consumed during workload operation – the ULPBench.. In November 2015, Ambiq Micro (www.ambiqmicro.com), a semiconductor vendor out of Austin, TX, submitted its Apollo MCU for testing against the ULPBench, scoring 377.50 (the reciprocal formula means the higher the benchmark score, the better), more than twice that of the previous bellwether, STMicroelectronics’ STM32L476RG. Depending on the direction of an application, this 2x power savings can be repurposed to extend battery life or add new features (Sidebar 1). According to Scott Hanson, Ph.D., Founder and CTO of Ambiq Micro, advances in energy efficiency such as those being realized today could lead to a new iteration of Moore’s law in which the power consumption of embedded microprocessors is cut in half every couple of years.. “What we’re seeing is every one of our customers wants to one-up their product from last year,” Hanson says. “If they want to add some great new feature – maybe last year it was heart rate monitoring and this year a microphone to do some always-on voice processing – that all takes CPU cycles. Today a lot of these companies are only running effectively at 1 million instructions per second (MIPS) or so, so very few cycles per second. Maybe they want to make a leap to 10 MIPS and, suddenly, MCU power goes from being a 25 percent contributor to a 75 percent contributor. That’s a problem.. “Much in the same way that Moore’s law was about adding more transistors in the same area, we have to be very focused on driving energy down 2x or 4x every single year,” he adds.. Sidebar 1 | Wearable energy efficiency beyond the battery. By Jamie Leland, Content Assistant. It’s true: charging a Fitbit couldn’t be simpler. Still, for a wearable device, especially one that requires 24-hour wear to take full advantage of its capabilities, charging even once a week feels like a chore. When the battery drains, it’s like your carriage turned back into a pumpkin. What was once the leading authority on your personal fitness level is now just an ugly, slightly uncomfortable bracelet. It’s so disenchanting that every time you put it on the charger, it might not make it back onto your wrist.. This is exactly the problem that Misfit wanted to remedy. Their goal? Produce a device that never needs to be removed. The result? Their original tracker, the Misfit Shine, boasted a six-month battery life; most activity trackers need to be charged at least once a week.. But while the Shine outpaced most other trackers in battery life, many users found the functionality to be too limited. The Shine was equipped with a Silicon Labs EFM32 MCU, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and a 3-axis accelerometer. That put the Shine about on par with Fitbit’s most basic offering, the Fitbit Zip, which, while not intended to track sleep, offers similar battery life and a more useful display. The next-generation Shine would need to add functionality without backpedaling on their commitment to long-term wear.. Enter Ambiq Micro’s Apollo MCU. The Apollo in the Misfit Shine 2, twice as powerful as the EFM32 MCU in the original Shine, allowed for the addition of a vibration motor for call and text notifications; multicolored LEDs and a capacitive touch sensor for a more clear, interactive user interface; and a magnetometer to improve the accuracy of activity tracking. Thanks to Ambiq’s SPOT platform, the Apollo also boasts industry-leading energy efficiency, mitigating tradeoffs in power consumption brought on by the added functionality to retain the six-month battery life of the Shine 2’s predecessor.. . [Figure 1 | The Misfit Shine 2 has a six-month battery life. Similar activity trackers, like Fitbit’s newest and most advanced “everyday” offering the Fitbit Alta, require a charge about every five days.]. But while the Apollo offers unparalleled power consumption compared to similar MCUs, the processor isn’t the only place where battery life can be extended. Other components, such as sensors and wireless chips, could also leverage sub-threshold circuitry such as that used on the Apollo MCU to reduce power, and software can be optimized to further increase energy efficiency.. The way Ambiq’s Chief Technology Officer Scott Hanson sees it, “We’re constantly going to be talking about how we need to be lower energy and the batteries need to be better. Every component needs to be more efficient than it is today. We’re always going to be under that pressure.”. Sub-threshold voltage circuitry demystified. What enables the Apollo MCU to achieve such notable ULP performance metrics is the use of sub-threshold circuitry, which operates on supply voltages below the threshold voltage of typical 1.8V or 3.3V MCUs. Threshold voltage represents the minimum gate-to-source voltage required to change a transistor’s state from “off” to “on” or drive a signal “low” or “high” for logic purposes. In a standard 1.8V integrated circuit (IC), significant current can be required to perform these state changes, which directly correlates with power consumption as dynamic energy – the energy associated with turning transistors on or off – is calculated by squaring the operating voltage (Figures 1 and 2).. . [Figure 1 | A typical 1.8V IC requires a significant amount of current to achieve a state change.]. . [Figure 2 | Dynamic power consumption, or the energy required to switch a transistor on or off, is responsible for the majority of the energy used by ICs, particularly at higher operating voltages.]. Ambiq, however, uses their Sub-threshold Power Optimized Technology, or SPOT, to operate transistors at voltages of less than 0.5V (sub-threshold), which provides a couple of benefits (Figure 3). First, state switching at these lower operating voltages makes for lower dynamic energy consumption; Second, the leakage current (see Figure 2) of “off” transistors can be harnessed to perform most computations, in essence recapturing previously lost power. In the case of Ambiq’s 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4F-based Apollo MCUs running at up to 24 MHz, the result is a platform that consumes 34 µA/MHz executing from flash and sleep currents as low as 140 nA, both of which are lower than competitive Cortex-M0+ offerings, the company says.. . [Figure 3 | Ambiq’s SPOT platform operates transistors at sub-threshold voltages of less than 0.5V to achieve significant energy savings compared to standard IC implementations.]. “What we effectively do is we take a normal microprocessor, including both the analog elements and the digital elements, and run them at much lower voltage,” Hanson explains. “On the digital side we dial down the voltage very low, anywhere between 200 mV and 600 mV, depending on the type of device you’re using. That requires a system-wide change in how you design the chip, from the standard cells to how you do simulations to how you do time enclosure to how you do voltage regulation – all of that has to be modified specifically to run at lower voltage. And then on the analog side we run at extremely low gate-to-source voltages, so we’ll use tail currents in amplifiers that are as low as a few picoamps.”. Sub-threshold circuitry is not without its challenges, however. While it can deliver exponential gains in energy efficiency, such low-voltage operation precludes processor speeds above a couple hundred MHz (for now) and also makes for circuits that are inherently more sensitive to fluctuations in temperature and voltage (Figure 4).. “This obviously comes with its share of problems,” Hanson says. “We’re very sensitive to temperature fluctuations and voltage fluctuations and process fluctuations, but we have a pretty wide range of techniques that we use to address that, for instance with proprietary analog circuit building blocks. Every analog circuit that you can read about in a textbook is based on saturated transistors and bipolar transistors, not sub-threshold-based MOSFETS, so we have had to reinvent a lot of the underlying analog circuit building blocks such that they work at extremely low sub-threshold currents.. . [Figure 4 | Besides exponential current fluctuations in response to changes in operating voltages at sub-threshold levels, slight temperature variations can lead to radical current deltas as well. This mandates significant compensation in sub-threshold circuitry.]. “Internally, we’re doing a lot of voltage conversion to get voltage down, we’re managing all the process variations, voltage variations, and temperature variations, and the result is dramatically lower energy,” Hanson continues. “There’s not any one silver bullet. There’s a wide range of things that we do to make sub-threshold possible.”. More than Moore’s. Advances in sub-threshold circuitry and voltage optimization will become more prevalent as Moore’s law continues to eke out smaller process nodes and the gate-to-source channels of MOSFETs shrink in size, necessitating lower and lower supply voltages as well as increasingly smaller thresholds. As Moore’s law advances towards the limits of physics, power consumption will become as much of a tenet of computing’s first amendment as performance, if not replace it.. “One of the challenges we see for Ambiq at a system level is that, as we’ve driven energy efficiency of the processor down, the overall contribution of the microprocessor to the system has gone down to the point where customers say, ‘Hey, you knock another 10x out of the energy, it doesn’t make a difference because you’re already very, very low,’” says Hanson. “What they really need is for us to knock that energy down by 10x, but they need a commensurate increase in performance to take advantage of that. That is to say, if I reduce energy by 10x, they want to see an accompanying 10x increase in performance so they can stay in the same power envelope but dramatically increase the processing power. We focus a lot on that as a company: How can I both increase performance and continue to reduce energy?. “We saw Moore’s law in the high-performance computing industry with PCs, notebooks, and phones. We saw Moore’s law lead the way in allowing us to deliver something better and more incredible every year so we could add more features, but we were kind of stuck in the same form factors, the same battery life, etc.,” Hanson continues. “We’re going to see the same thing happen with power consumption, and that means that we’re constantly going to be talking about how we need lower energy in every component.”.  .

Mainframes lived in glass rooms accessible to a few carefully screened attendants. If there was any kind of network, it existed within the building and provided wired connectivity for a flock of dumb terminals.. The big change came with the arrival of the Internet. Suddenly, the network covered the planet, and the same web that provided 24/7 access for remote offices, customers, partners, and friends substituted once-secure physical walls for loose affiliations open to any interested party that cared to visit. It made security a critical issue and spawned an entire industry.. With the advent of embedded technology, intelligence continued migrating from fortified data centers to millions of devices, each with its own functions and place on the web. This spread presented a target-rich environment for bad actors around the world. These weren’t just criminals, though there are plenty of those; they consisted of anyone from state actors and terrorists to curious individuals simply looking for a challenge or a place to play. Whoever they may be, these individuals could maliciously or even unintentionally alter, steal, or otherwise tamper with content.. With Internet of Things (IoT) nodes showing up in home appliances, medical devices, kiosks, vehicles, buildings, utilities, and other sorts of infrastructure, the number of IoT devices will be huge. They’ll be sensors collecting, storing, and transmitting data and components of a smart grid. They’ll send anything from occasional alerts to large streams of real-time data and will link vast arrays of unattended devices into networks. They’ll differ in size and capabilities, but the one thing they will all have in common is connectivity. And in reality, if it’s connected, it’s vulnerable. The big question today is, how do we protect the growing number of small, relatively inexpensive, autonomous devices that make up the IoT?. The challenges. Embedded devices in IoT applications face assault from many directions and in many forms. Being connected devices, they can be reached via wired or wireless connections. And they can still be attacked “the old fashioned way” by direct physical access, which is a greater problem than ever because there are so many of them in so many places and because they usually operate unattended.. Before deploying an IoT device, consider these issues first:. The checklist. The bottom line. Unfortunately, perfect security doesn’t exist. Witness recent break-ins at well-protected government and corporate sites and the FBI’s highly publicized hacking of an iPhone. The goal isn’t to make interference impossible, but rather to make it difficult. IoT systems and devices may be tempting for hackers, but they aren’t Fort Knox or the Bank of England’s vault, and successful security may simply entail using the toughest available protection and counting on rational hackers to look elsewhere for a softer target..

22,"This website collects personal data and uses cookies to improve services. By using this site, you agree to our Privacy Policy.. A new COM Express specification developed by the PICMG is soon to be released. One of the upcoming major advancements is the COM Express Type 7 pinout supporting up to four 10GbE-KR interfaces, making it ideally suited for the new edge node servers required by IoT and Industry 4.0 applications.. By 2020, it is expected that data created and copied annually (much of it from IoT, cloud, and big data applications) will increase to around 44 zettabytes. That’s 44 trillion gigabytes. In order to minimize traffic between clients, central clouds, and data centers, data should be processed as close as possible to its place of origin or inquiry location. IoT and Industry 4.0 applications need this decentralized capacity to process sensor and measurement data in real time. In particular, data-intensive video streaming applications need local, virtualized systems with multiple cores and larger caches to achieve the required transcoding performance. This is not only relevant for video-on-demand in the telecom segment, but also for medical and security applications. Another important application for edge servers is deep packet inspection, which ensures data security and optimal quality of service.. The structure of the network is thus transformed to an infrastructure which uses high-performance edge node servers distributed over the whole network that perform their functions close to the end user, reducing latency and backbone traffic. A high bandwidth of 10GbE is essential for such appliances. Examples of system-on-chip solutions which provide this performance at a relatively low power consumption of 65 watts or less are the Intel Xeon processor D family and the Intel Atom processor C family. ARM designs are also interesting, such as the recently launched AMD Opteron A1100 ARM processor and various PowerPC platforms, such as the QorIQ family from NXP. Developers do not, however, need to decide today which processor is the best platform. They can stay flexible using the new COM Express specification with Type 7 pinout.. [Figure 1 | The new Type 7 pinout provides up to four 10GbE-KR ports for bandwidth- and data-intensive designs.]. The new Type 7 pinout. One of the most fundamental innovations of the COM Express Type 7 pinout is the support of up to four 10GbE interfaces, essential for the next generation of edge node appliances. On the module they are implemented as 10GbE-KR, i.e. as single backplane lanes according to IEEE 802.3, paragraph 49. The physical implementation of the 10GbE interfaces takes place on the carrier board itself. Developers can define the signal transmission as optical (SFP+), copper cable (T). This provides flexibility for new designs.. . [Figure 2 | The new Type 7 pinout provides up to 4x 10GbE-KR for bandwidth- and data-intensive designs.]. To a large degree, the Type 7 pinout follows that of Type 6. To create the capacity for up to four 10GbE interfaces, the signal lines of the digital display interfaces (DDIs) on the CD connector of the Type 6 pinout are used. Since most new edge node appliances do not require high-resolution, multi-screen outputs, multiple DDI interfaces are not needed for these applications. For local management and maintenance consoles, the eDP/LVDS interface is still available and located on the AB connector. If developers wish to retain DDI, a hybrid solution with 2x 10GbE and a DDI interface will be supported by the specification. Together with the eDP/LVDS interface on the AB connector, solutions that offer both high network and video performance are also possible.. No change is expected to the existing 1 GbE port on the Type 6 AB connector. However, there are discussions on expanding this port to 10GbE, including the physical definition and PHY for 10GBASE-T. This matter can only be decided when conventional non-server processors such as the Intel Core processor family have comprehensively integrated 10GbE including PHY, which is not likely to take place before 2018.. 1U with up to 10 modules. With COM Express Type 7, the benefits of the COM Express specification are made available to new, high-bandwidth, data-intensive edge node server applications. Thanks to the core-module design concept and standardized pinout, system design becomes independent of processor technology. Systems can be upgraded with a simple module exchange. And thanks to its compact dimensions, COM Express modules enable a high packing density: 10 modules can be integrated in a 1U enclosure, providing a maximum combined data transfer rate of 0.4 terabits per second. The modular COM Express design makes this type of solution highly flexible and scalable, minimizes development costs, and shortens time-to-market. OEMs also gain more design security and can use their designs for longer, thereby increasing their return on investment.. [Figure 3 | ADLINK COM Express Type 7 block diagram. Check the ADLINK website for updated product information.]. Further upgrades. ADLINK has played a leading role in the PICMG subcommittee that is currently defining the new COM Express 3.0 specification. The new specification, which benefitted from the technical contributions of several key PICMG member companies, is expected to become available at the end Q2 2016, with the Type 7 CD connector pin assignment expected to be released at the end of Q1 to allow vendors to begin working on new designs. The COM Express Rev. 3.0 specification will include both the new Type 7 pinout as well as expected changes to existing pinout types to address minor issues and to migrate from the legacy LPC bus to the eSPI bus. The group is also trying to achieve greater unification on the AB connector between the existing Type 6 and Type 10 pinouts in order to simplify design considerations for manufacturers.. Jeff Munch, Chief Technology Officer of ADLINK, has been Chairman of most PICMG COM Express subcommittees since 2009. In this role he has headed the last five of seven COM Express initiatives, including COM Express Type 7, and has brought together companies such as Advantech, Congatec, Kontron, MSC/Avnet and Intel..

Ethernet seems a logical choice for in-vehicle networking due to speed and cost advantages. How is the automotive industry leveraging Ethernet today?. TAN: Ethernet, of course, has been extremely successful in the consumer and enterprise space, but is also used in many other applications. One of the first areas that it moved into was on the industrial side where basically it was shown that you can take this IP-based, non-deterministic, loose network and use it to control real-time systems and critical systems. It moved into industrial where it was adopted for PROFINET, SERCOS III, and DeviceNet, but a number of different industrial technologies. It also went into the smart grid for electrical distribution. The model there was to take standard Ethernet and then develop the upper level protocols that work on top of the IP to allow real-time operation.. In the car, what drove interest in Ethernet was really the need for bandwidth. I believe BMW was the first company that was very vocal about this. They looked at the situation back in 2007 and said, “In the mid-2010s we’re going to have so many processors running so many lines of code that if we use the existing proprietary technology, if there’s any reason to flash the software, a BMW owner’s going to have to bring in their car for two days to be able to flash everything.” That’s a huge problem, and there you give them credit for looking forward to bring in a new technology, and naturally they looked at Ethernet.. The first thing they found is that, from a protocol standpoint, Ethernet was pretty good, but the physical layer of the vehicle network itself didn’t match the requirements for Ethernet because the physical layer for a car is extremely unique and robust: you have EMI concerns; you have ruggedness concerns; your cables go under water and get dirty and shake; and the weight even of a cable, even of a screw for these car manufacturers, adds to the cost in terms of miles per gallon.. That’s where the industry was before they moved into Ethernet, so two things had to happen. One thing was the development of single-pair Ethernet (100BASE-T1) through the IEEE, and then the development of Gigabit Ethernet (GbE), the 1000BASE-T1.. Once you bring Ethernet into a system, whether it’s automotive, industrial, smart grid, or energy infrastructure, you find that there are many, many other advantages and new capabilities that are enabled by that kind of bandwidth. Even 100 Mb Ethernet that’s bi-directional, configurable, and IP-based gives you a lot of capability, and is very different from anything that’s been in the car before. If you look at CAN or LIN or MOST, each of those had a very specifically defined architecture designed for specific applications in the car, but where MOST was for infotainment, CAN for control signals, and LIN for safety, with the advent of Ethernet you can take CAN signals, for instance, encapsulate them in IP packages, and send them through your CAN network. This opens up an explosion of new applications.. Today everybody’s talking about how, by the mid 2020s, there will be various levels of autonomous cars. Well, the technology’s there today, of course, we just have to look at what Google’s doing or what Audi did two CESs ago when a car drove itself from San Francisco to Las Vegas. But taking that and making it into a production car that you can buy for your kids as their first car when they get out of school, that’s a huge difference, right? It’s not just having the technology, but it has to meet automotive requirements and automotive costs, too.. The GbE that we’re developing is the backbone or infrastructure to connect the different domains in the car – what was traditionally an infotainment domain, an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) domain, a body electronics domain, and a control domain – and connecting them all together. The next step is using that information to connect with the other sensors that are required for autonomous vehicles. All of these can act together and give you the performance you need.. The second step is not just connecting the inside of the car, but connecting the car to the cloud. Your car becomes an extension of the Internet of Things (IoT). Just recently I changed the lock on my house to one that’s Apple HomeKit compatible so I can use my phone and see whether or not my front door is locked. My car should be able to tell me the same thing, and, in fact, there’s more information I want from my car. Is it locked? What’s the temperature inside? Is it low on gas? If you get locked out, wouldn’t it be great to be able to grab your phone and get in there and open it up? All these things are really useful.. That’s what Ethernet gives you. It’s this really flexible backbone so that if there is a new application, that new application can be added to cars. You need the flexibility that the architecture you build today can allow your car to support features that haven’t even been thought of yet. As it is, it’s really hard because an architect is going to be designing maybe five to seven years in advance of release, and they have to already be thinking what the marketing guy that’s selling a Ford Fiesta going to want for their infotainment system in seven years, which is pretty much impossible.. Ethernet presents concerns about packet loss. How does automotive-grade Ethernet reduce packet loss that could have huge ramifications on vehicle safety?. TAN: The basis of that answer comes from industrial, because before automotive picked it up, the industrial guys found ways to take their old PROFIBUS-type technology and replace it with Ethernet. In those scenarios, if you’re using Ethernet to control a robotic arm and lose one of your data packets, the arm could go where it shouldn’t be and that could be extremely dangerous as well as very bad for manufacturing. So a number of real time protocols were developed that basically sit on top of the IP and allow deterministic, real-time control over a fundamentally non-deterministic network. One of the base technologies was an IEEE standard called the 1588 precision time protocol (PTP), and that protocol allowed different nodes on the network to exchange their times so they could operate synchronously (Figure 1). That’s robust enough for a very controlled environment, but the next step is to make sure you don’t lose packets because Ethernet by nature is bursty, meaning an event happens where you send as much data as you can, use the full bandwidth, and nothing is sent, or you have two events at the same time each fighting for bandwidth.. [Figure 1 | The IEEE 1588 precision time protocol was designed to synchronize Ethernet-based embedded systems for real-time operation.]. Fortunately, there’s a subset of standards called IEEE 802.1AS that was developed for audio video bridging (AVB) and whose interoperability is governed by the AVnu Alliance. Originally, these standards were designed for professional concert venues because, again, you need to have accurate timing but that’s not good enough if every note is at the same time but the audio doesn’t get to one of the speakers because it’s blocked by another packet indicating status or something. What AVB does is allow you to allocate bandwidth on your network dynamically so that you have the bandwidth you need to protect time-dependent streaming flows (Figure 2).. [Figure 2 | The Audio Video Bridging (AVB) portion of IEEE 802.1AS was developed to ensure the delivery of time-dependent streaming flows to various network nodes through traffic shaping.]. AVB technology is now being adapted for automotive and industrial applications by a new set of 802.1 sub standards called Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) that are moving away from the audio/video route (Figure 3). TSN takes it to the next level to guarantee traffic protection and delivery. For instance, in a car system today, you would use AVB with these TSN extensions in your software for your switches and your PHYs, and then all of your input data is guaranteed 50 Mbps, or whatever the required bandwidth is. But then, if you turn off the input system, that bandwidth becomes completely available if you want to do a one-time flash to update all of your processors, for example. So it’s not as limiting as saying that we have a completely segregated network just for video, say, but instead it allows you to protect the video that needs to be protected and to take advantage of the full use of the system as well. The other part of that is that you do hit your limits, and that’s where GbE becomes really valuable because if you have different networks operating at 100 Mb speeds and connect them over GbE, you don’t need to worry about the high-level data that’s being aggregated getting lost in transfer.. [Figure 3 | The new Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) group of IEEE standards extends the determinism of AVB for Ethernet-based networks by dedicating network resources to particular nodes/applications.]. The automotive guys didn’t have to do anything other than adopt the technology that had already been designed and proven for industrial and for audio. This is one of the areas Marvell Semiconductor has been a technology leader in developing both PTP and also the AVB TSN, and we implement a lot of the more computationally difficult parts of those protocols directly in our hardware (Figure 4). So this makes it much easier to make the software and administrate the network and it also makes the network much faster, reducing latency so they can operate fast enough for the requirements of a car where you’re sending video as you’re driving along the road or something like that.. [Figure 4 | Marvell’s automotive Ethernet reference platform with integrated MATEnet connectors for Automotive Ethernet from TE Connectivity includes two 1000BASE-T1 PHY, two 100BASE-T1 PHYs, two standard Ethernet PHYs, and a built in switch supporting Audio/Video Bridging and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) protocols.]. Will automotive-grade Ethernet keep pushing bandwidth like we’ve seen in traditional network infrastructure?. TAN: I was in Munich for the Automotive Ethernet Congress and during the first keynote speech, there was a question to the crowd about exactly that: Are we done here with 1GB? It was very clear from the number of hands in the crowd that there’s a lot of interest in higher speed Ethernet. It’s interesting, because what I see is that in two to five years time, the most sophisticated IT professionals in the world will be working at the major car companies. They will be doing the most amazing things with real-time and TSN and future technologies. Going forward it will get faster because they moved directly from 100 Mb to GbE in a short period of time and there’s already interest in compelling applications for higher speed solutions. 10 GbE in the car is very much a possibility in the next decade or so.

24,"Software defined networks (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) are key technologies driving data center scaling at the enterprise and cloud application level. Virtualization is extending its reach into network infrastructure and Internet of Things (IoT) applications as well. I caught up with Patrick Blesso, Senior Manager, Product Portfolio at GlobeNet, about their international virtualization strategy and how it can extend reach and lower cost of delivering network services.. Virtualization primer. Virtualization is based on the premise that all functional systems boil down into common compute, storage, and network resources. In the networking world, network architectures are the starting point for deploying wired and wireless networks. Interfaces and functional components are defined. Once the reference architecture is established, equipment manufacturers develop the components that implement these functions and interfaces using fixed-function hardware.. Over the past 5 years, the networking world has taken a page out of the enterprise virtualization playbook. Instead of creating all these fixed-function hardware components, functions have been abstracted away from purpose-built hardware and have become software-only functions (i.e., “virtualized”). These virtualized functions simply require an abstracted interface to compute, storage and network resources. This network virtualization paradigm has dramatically changed the economics and development execution of network infrastructure. Virtualization has started becoming a mainstream feature of LTE networks. Ericsson and Nokia currently have products that virtualize the LTE mobile infrastructure MME, signaling gateway (S-GW) and packet gateway (P-GW) functions. Ericsson has publicly announced that they intend to have their entire LTE portfolio virtualized by the end of 2016.. Virtualization is taking hold in the networking world. However, its reach isn’t limited to wireless infrastructure. A number of router, voice over IP (VoIP) session border controller (SBC), and cable network providers are also virtualizing network functions within their networks as well.. GlobeNet’s take on virtualization. GlobeNet is a submarine network operator providing wholesale transport services in Latin and North America. Globenet provides network capacity to ISPs in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. These ISPs need ways to extend their reach in the US, but capital expense challenges to manage deployment, needed licenses, and US taxes are major roadblocks to these initiatives. Likewise, providers in the US have significant interest in extending their services to Latin and South America. These providers are willing to connect to specific Internet exchange points, but are faced the same challenges.. Geographic reach, increased capacity. GlobeNet’s international virtualization architecture includes virtual routers located in Miami, New York, and Sao Paulo, which allows customers to expand network reach, improve performance, aggregate international capacity, and manage the connections to peering fabrics. These routers become an integral part of customers’ networks for the extended delivery of their service offering. Transport services between international locations are also available as part of the offering.. Management capabilities are also provided, which allow customers to manage their network architecture and capacity upgrades as needed. Basic engineering services are provided by GlobeNet so customers can quickly manage and control their extended network.. Scalability is a critical aspect for these international providers from a geographic reach and capacity standpoint. In a recent GlobeNet press release, Erick Contag, President and Chief Executive Officer said, “Carriers and ISPs need to present additional value to their customers in order to stand out in the competitive global telecommunications market. Virtualization enhances any customer network by expanding it to critical global points of presence without having to invest in the deployment of a subsea fiber system or purchase expensive equipment.”. Under the hood. GlobeNet leverages Juniper hardware to deploy their virtualization services, which can enable customers such as ISPs, Internet exchanges, and tier 1 providers.. “We chose Juniper routers because of the performance and latency benchmarks they offer,” Patrick Blesso said. “The infrastructure is internalized into the customer networks. In addition to the increased capacity, we offer management of routers, ports, upgrades, and protocols, so operating within this extended virtual environment can adhere to the same availability and reliability standards they currently operate within.”. The physical infrastructure is shared, but logically segmented across the customer base. When virtual routers are spun up, they make ports available to customers according to their bandwidth needs. These router instances can be scaled up and down to optimize power and capacity.. Security is another important aspect of the environment. “There are distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation capabilities within the infrastructure. Router spin-up and configuration is also controlled through a secure virtual private network (VPN). Once the router is brought up, the customer can configure restrictions for port access and bring the virtual environment into their security domain,” Blesso said.. The business model for service providers is attractive – they can dip their toe into international markets without having to outlay large amounts of capital expense to determine if their strategy is a good one. Getting bandwidth and access as a service provides for an incremental entry into other regions.. There are adopters utilizing this virtual environment today. A tier 1 provider in Colombia is using the GlobeNet platform and is successfully managing their extended network in Colombia and the US. They are currently using multiple 10 GbE in total bandwidth.. Summary. Virtualization has historically been used to scale web applications across multiple server platforms in a data center. GlobeNet is an example of leveraging virtualization to extend geographic reach and increase service areas without requiring a large capital expense. Early adopters are successfully extending their geographic reach while still effectively managing their combined physical and virtual network. The virtual network environment enables GlobeNet to focus in the areas of transport and increased security, which can help network operators extend reach while still providing high reliability services.. © OpenSystems Media.

Chipmakers aren’t selling simple chips anymore; they are selling complete ecosystems that encompass software, development tools, design libraries, and strategic partnerships. Chip consumers aren’t buying fixed-function parts anymore; they are buying the potential to adapt their products to changing market demands.. Today, semiconductor manufacturers are considered silicon suppliers for the Internet of Things (IoT), the hyper-connected world comprised of intelligent devices at one end and cloud computing infrastructure at the other. Chip vendors have historically delivered microcontroller, sensor, and connectivity solutions into the volume markets now referred to as the “edge” and “gateway” tiers of the IoT (Figure 1), which traditionally involved supplying static, application-specific standard products (ASSPs) to fit the requirements of as many use cases as possible. SKUs were developed in silos with specifications, technical requirements, and other information largely isolated from the bigger picture of larger, more complex designs and other development teams within the organization. However, in the context of a connected world that now demands near-real-time design flexibility and rapid innovation in products and services, those conventional approaches to development must change.. [Figure 1 | Silicon vendors typically deliver solutions to the edge and gateway levels of the Internet of Things (IoT) that have higher volumes, but also increasing requirements for diversity and longevity. Image courtesy Atmel.]. Silicon’s new status quo and the digital thread of requirements management. The IoT is about speed and flexibility, even when it comes to hardware. As such, silicon vendors are developing complex system-on-chips (SoCs) with two to three times more memory and performance than what is required by today’s solutions, anticipating that application and system requirements will evolve and grow over time. For both chipmakers and their customers, this extra headroom implies that new features can be delivered using remote software/firmware updates, but it also means that static product lifecycle management processes are a thing of the past. Especially for silicon shipping into embedded systems expected to last 10-plus years in many cases, the IoT movement and Agile techniques have made version control truly a living endeavor, again for both the parts being supplied by semiconductor vendors as well as the end products of the customers they support.. Not surprisingly, therefore, producers of IoT silicon now increasingly demand requirements management (RM) platforms that can help engineers and product managers ensure traceability, increase efficiency, and eliminate rework across multiple SKUs, development teams, and technology areas. In other words, semiconductor suppliers need a digital thread capable of linking technical revisions, stakeholder requirements, and verification and validation efforts across geographies and over time. These solutions must provide a transparent repository that promotes collaboration without burdening participants with extraneous information, and should be accessible across departments, organizations, and, in some cases, even supply chains.. For example, chipmakers who supply MCUs and other chips for the IoT market are using Jama Software to manage a multifaceted design process that links various IoT building blocks such as sensors and actuators into their IoT chip design cycle (Figure 2). The following takes a look at how concise, specific, and parametric RM systems assist semis in adding value for themselves and their customers.. [Figure 2 | A structured collaboration process allows design engineers, verification engineers and test engineers to work in a shared space, even across organizations and supply chains.]. 1. Expanding chip ecosystems. Chipmakers, as mentioned above, are now selling complete solutions, including evaluation boards, software libraries, software development kits (SDKs), protocol stacks, and more. So chipmakers, their OEM customers, and software partners have to keep track of an extensive amalgam of technical details, specifications, requirements, tasks, and goals.. Now add the fragmented IoT world to this mix and what chipmakers have at hand is a vast array of hardware and software solutions that increasingly demand a centralized requirements repository. It will keep track of each subsection and act as a hub of processor development efforts across multiple teams, particularly as system-on-chip (SoCs) continue to package more heterogeneous IP blocks and components onto a single die.. 2. Multiple facets of SoC design. SoC designs entail the development of hardware, firmware, and software that is usually carried out at multiple locations, often scattered around the globe. A chipmaker may have its IP database in Silicon Valley while the memory design work is being carried out in Bangalore, India.. This globalization adds cultural and language barriers to an already complex design workflow that includes tight schedules and deadlines. Moreover, there are performance issues when engineers at multiple locations attempt to check in and out at the same time.. It’s imperative that everyone is working on the most recent version, and that a robust change management process is in place to eliminate the duplicity of work and wastage of man-hours. A requirements and specifications management system offers a clear picture of the impact of change and an easy traceability of that change (Figure 3).. [Figure 3 | Jama’s RM software enables different workflows and development teams to operate in a single common space.]. 3. IP and design reuse. Chip designers are increasingly using IP blocks from internal and external sources, and in order to effectively handle IP reuse and system partitioning, chip designers need to keep track of all the design blocks at all times. Moreover, they must keep track of various versions of the IP content such as schematics, layout, simulation, and technology kits.. The intertwined world of IPs, cores, and design methodologies makes it hard for traditional document-based product development workflows to handle increasingly complex chip design cycles. Here, features like workflow mapping available from RM systems like Jama allow design teams to work in their particular space while simultaneously collaborating with other teams in real-time to quickly responding to changes in design workflows.. 4. Foundry liaison. After tape-out, the next big thing is the liaison with the foundry, and here, new technology nodes, tight delivery schedules, and unique customer functional requirements demand a dynamic system that can track changes happening on multiple axes. These changes are dynamic because multiple designers are operating on the same data.. It’s crucial for chipmakers coordinating cross-functional deliverables related to design, manufacturing, IP, and software development to use a robust RM system that keeps all stakeholders tied to a system of action like Jama. This allows engineers to efficiently handle end-to-end product development with a traceability that shows the impact not just on technical or specification requirements, but also on the people.. The thread that ties it all together. A digital thread driving requirements management within a product development cycle is highly relevant for semiconductor firms developing for the extreme diversity of the Internet of Things, especially as they take on more elements of a complete solution to better serve their customers. Today’s RM platforms can facilitate these intricacies while advancing technology reuse and speeding time to market, as well as provide an apparatus for collaboration for all stakeholders involved..

The way the industrial world approaches process management and control is changing. The concept of interconnectedness of intelligent devices in the consumer world is permeating the industrial realm. The resulting interconnected industrial environment is delivering a whole set of benefits – efficiency, safety, and profitability among them. However, while Internet of Things (IoT) concepts can be applied to industrial devices, assets, and infrastructure, the Industrial IoT (IIoT) has much stricter requirements in terms of quality, security, reliability, synchronization, and so on. As such, these systems are more complex and challenging.. The need to move intelligence closer to critical processes has driven the adoption of IoT concepts in the industry, allowing for timely reaction to critical events, effective data reduction, and secure dissemination of information. The increasing availability of low-cost intelligent systems featuring heterogeneous computing architectures for control and data aggregation operations has made this achievable. Such systems do not operate in silos, but rather are part of a system of systems that generate data used to predict situations and make smarter, more informed decisions (Figure 1).. [Figure 1 | Trends in the Industrial Internet of Things]. From the architectural point of view, IIoT embedded devices must have compelling processing capabilities to deliver significant results. Heterogeneous computing architectures that encompass a mix of general-purpose processors and massive parallel elements (Figure 2) are suitable for advanced IIoT applications. General-purpose processors provide powerful, stand-alone execution of floating point operations, data logging, and connectivity. And massive parallel elements such as FPGAs and graphics processing units are used to reduce data, customize algorithms, and quickly respond to critical events.. 
[Figure 2 | Example of heterogeneous computing architectures]. From the security point of view, because IIoT embedded devices operate at the edge, they also represent the last line of defense against attackers. This is often overlooked during the design cycle of such devices because more immediate issues such as lack of domain expertise, implementation costs, and time-to-market constraints relegate security to a secondary plane of importance. Consequently, the 2010 Stuxnet attack exposed the true vulnerability of these systems, demonstrated how much damage an industrial breach can cause, and publicly positioned industrial applications as potential targets.. Wind turbines, nuclear plants, oil and gas pipelines, and similar industrial assets are now the target of government and hacktivist groups that exploit vulnerabilities in industrial devices. The US Department of Homeland Security Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) estimates that attacks on US industrial targets climbed from 41 in 2010 to 198 in 2011 and 245 in 2014. As this trend continues, it is paramount to consider a different approach that would introduce cyber security concepts from the early stages of embedded device design to prevent, mitigate, and predict attacks that target highly sensitive industrial operations.. The problem described urges both a change in the way embedded devices are developed and a re-evaluation of security standards applicable to such devices. Integrated development platforms and standardization are required to guarantee seamless implementation of security requirements while maintaining interoperability with other IIoT entities. Initiatives such as the IIoT and Industrie 4.0 provide best practices and recommendations to address these challenges. However, the integration of these recommendations into an open development platform is still a big challenge the industry must overcome.. A flexible platform with support for standardized, open security technologies would greatly reduce the expertise needed to develop IIoT applications while increasing security in industrial systems. The key to making this platform useful for the IIoT is integrating the right security features so applications can automatically benefit from them. Unfortunately, a widely applicable security standard for the IIoT is still incomplete and immature (Figure 3). Until this standard is ready, designers must look for commonality among existing related standards and fill in any gaps for an integrated solution. A set of widely agreed-upon security features is possible today through open technology such as Linux.. [Figure 3 | Proposed core set of security requirements for IIoT embedded devices]. The realization of the IIoT as a feasible approach for making industrial processes more efficient requires using platforms and standards. A platform-based approach is essential to provide embedded designers with development frameworks flexible enough to meet the requirements of multiple application areas. The security aspect of these applications should not be treated differently. A platform that can enable a core set of security requirements common across multiple application areas is a first step toward security best practices standardization for the IIoT. Security features must be fully integrated into development frameworks to be useful to domain experts and embedded engineers unfamiliar with security concepts. Commercially available heterogeneous computing architectures paired with an open, flexible operating system such as Linux (Figure 4) can provide the elements for a development platform that meets the IIoT’s security needs..

CIA, TPM and IoT: You might ask what these three acronyms have in common and how they relate to each other. To make a long story short, it is all about security, trust, and reliability.. The abbreviation CIA in this context does not mean the Central Intelligence Agency. It is an abbreviation for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authenticity. The so-called CIA principle is a simple, but widely used, security model covering three key tenets that should be guaranteed by all secure systems.. Now that we understand why CIA is important for a secure system, let’s move to the third acronym: IoT.. After many years of being an overhyped marketing term, the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) is starting to become mature and real. Mark Weiser created the term “ubiquitous computing” first in his famous Scientific American article “The Computer for the 21st Century”, published September 1991. His thinking was so ahead of his time that it seemed like science fiction to most of his readers. In 2016, his vision has become reality. Ubiquitous computing (or ubicomp for short) became today’s – perhaps overhyped – IoT.. Weiser started his article, “The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.” He predicted that computing devices would become commonplace and part of all aspects of life, and he was right. Just consider, for example, the consumer gadgets like fitness bands, smart watches, smart phones, or navigation systems that send and receive data all day long. Or, consider the home, which is connected to a power grid where a smart meter allows the energy provider to effectively calculate the resources needed to cover the demand of all households. Interconnected computing devices are everywhere nowadays.. Shifting focus to industrial applications, today’s business IoT applications are developed together, with devices and services coming from various sectors of industry: information technology, automation, and production technology, aerospace, maritime, and naval systems, railways, car manufacturers and their suppliers, energy providers, agricultural, medical technology, and building automation. All of those share characteristics, including long life in the field: reliability and robustness in harsh environments and reliable, long-term availability.. IoT systems rely on public networks, but public networks are not secure environments. While IoT creates new capabilities and services, allows greater efficiencies, increases flexibility, and enables the customization of single production units, it also opens up previously closed systems and allows attackers to get access to those systems from the outside world.. Attackers often use reverse engineering techniques to identify software vulnerabilities, which they can exploit to create counterfeit products, steal sensitive data, or tamper with the device for sabotage and espionage purposes. This can lead to serious and dangerous hacks, as recent attacks on safety-critical automotive, aerospace, and medical components have shown.. . . This brings us back to the CIA principle we started with. The only way to avoid situations like those listed above is to apply the CIA security model to the world of IoT devices. As we have learned, CIA is built around cryprograhic operations. Today’s modern cryprography leverages standard crypto protocols. The Dutch cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffs stated a maxim in the 19th century that would become known as Kerckhoffs’ principle: A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except for the key, is public knowledge.. I repeat, everything is public knowledge except for the key, which is needed to encrypt and decrypt the content, either directly or in a derived form. So, how do you store a key in a secure manner? This brings me to the second acronym: TPM, the Trusted Platform Module.. In the world of cryptography, there is a ton of other acronyms referring to the various protocols and methods that are used to ensure the CIA principle. To name just a few of them, you have DES, AES for symmetric cryptography and RSA, ECC for asymmetric cryptography. The list of acronyms goes on and on. The really important part, however, is that the algorithms themselves are typically not secret; they are publicly available, just as Kerckhoffs’ principle demands it. The only part that really needs to be kept secret is the key itself. This sounds simple, but it is pretty hard to achieve. To keep the key secret, you need a secure place like a safe, which we will call a secure element, to securely store the key. A TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is such a secure element, and it offers a lot more, including the crypto protocols.. In a nutshell, a TPM is a specialized and dedicated device that offers crypto operations and secure storage for secret keys, all in one. This allows you to store the key in a secure place and, even more importantly, it allows the key to stay there, so it never leaves its secure location. All important crypto operations are done inside of the TPM itself, and only the results are exposed. This prevents the key from getting compromised. In case you want to know why it is important to have this dedicated functionality separated in a dedicated device, I recommend you to read the following two articles. These should make it obvious how important it is to have a dedicated, secure element like a TPM inside a computing device to make it secure, trustable, and reliable.. . So how can incidents like these be prevented? Use technology that creates secured code and licenses that can be bound to a secure element in the target system, ensuring that the code and the licensed features can only be used on an individual system. License creation and deployment can be integrated into existing business processes, such as ERP systems or e-commerce platforms. This mechanism opens up new business models, such as feature-on-demand upselling and time-based or pay-per-use licenses for the IoT and other intelligent devices. The result is improved security from attacks, malware, theft, and other malfeasance for code and IP.. Guenther Fischer is a Senior Licensing and Protection Consultant at Wibu-Systems.

28,"System-on-chip (SoC) designers must confront a new learning curve to build SoC solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is challenging for designers because SoCs must support a variety of mobile or mobile-influenced IoT applications and use cases while ensuring that the components and end products perform well within the required operational and cost constraints for small-sized devices. This article describes IoT use cases and interface and connectivity specifications that designers should consider to quickly bring to market innovative products that successfully meet the needs of targeted applications.. The IoT ecosystem is broad, complex, and rapidly evolving. It also means different things to different people. A good overall definition comes from the Internet Society, which characterizes IoT as “scenarios where network connectivity and computing capability extend to objects, sensors, and everyday items not normally considered computers, allowing these devices to generate, exchange, and consume data with minimal human intervention[1].”1. To estimate the fast growth and scale of this market, McKinsey Global Institute has projected that by 2025 the IoT could bring connectivity to 100 billion devices. It will also drive strong demand for components that are used to build IoT products. The firm reports that from 2013 to 2014, the market for IoT components and systems grew 160 percent and McKinsey expects that demand will continue to drive component growth at a rate of 30 percent per year through 2025[2].. IoT systems consist of numerous sensors with the associated electronics. The sensors are connected to the cloud wirelessly or via a standard network interface such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi – however, a single connectivity solution does not fit all. The use of wireless connectivity in an IoT system, for example, depends on the distance, bandwidth, security, and other variables specific to the use case. To add to the complexity, the SoC option at each stage of the IoT system will vary, ranging from high-end to low-end designs. The following sections describe these options and the role of MIPI Alliance interfaces in each.. Characterizing SoC designs for IoT. Before building IoT SoCs, designers need to characterize the key features the SoC must support and determine the interfaces that are most suitable for interconnecting the required components.. A practical approach is to segment designs according to high-end or low-end use cases and apply these classifications to establish SoC and peripheral IC connectivity requirements. Because IoT devices can have very small form factors, designers need techniques that can cost-effectively accommodate multiple components in limited board space while ensuring low-power consumption, efficient operation, and low electromagnetic interference (EMI). Designers also need flexibility to meet a variety of market needs. Fundamentally, they need to make sure their designs are able to adapt to today’s and tomorrow’s required features and interfaces while maintaining a small silicon footprint and low cost, particularly for price-sensitive applications.. High-end applications and associated interface specifications. High-end IoT applications include wearables such as smart watches, in-sight display (glass) applications, virtual or augmented reality (AR) head-mounted displays, and gaming products. Many of these applications will employ machine learning.. Such devices are manufactured in moderate volumes associated with niche and often high-priced products. Typically, the SoC will interface with a camera, a display that has graphics capability, and sensors. The SoC block will typically run an OS and include on-chip memory, security functions, and sometimes an audio interface (Figure 1).. . High-end IoT products will connect wirelessly with other devices and to the Internet. Many devices will use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth low energy (BLE) for connectivity. Others will interconnect with and sometimes enable fast data exchange with the cellular network. In the future, 5G connectivity will allow ultra-fast transmission and reception and enable applications such as robotics to have the computing power and fast connectivity needed for multi-sensing systems.. Cameras, displays, and sensors will play significant roles in these devices, and engineers will seek methods that can conveniently interface the components to deliver the required throughput while minimizing pin count, energy consumption, and electromagnetic interference (EMI). MIPI Alliance and its working group members have developed the required specifications to enable complete interfaces and efficient connectivity in high-end SoCs.. Designers can interconnect cameras and high-end SoCs with the MIPI Alliance Camera Serial Interface (CSI-2), which interfaces cameras in smartphones and can support a broad range of imaging solutions. Displays can be supported with the MIPI Display Serial Interface (DSI), which connects to displays in smartphones today. If a product needs routine audio features, audio sensing, or voice trigger capabilities such as a human machine interface, MIPI SoundWire can be used to support these attributes.. Recommendations for practical and versatile low-end designs. Low-end IoT use cases, similar to machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, are designed primarily to gather and transmit data from sensors and may or may not need additional features. The devices can function with a real-time operating system and they will typically run on a coin cell or AA battery. BLE is the most practical option for wireless connectivity. Low-end devices could potentially include a display or a camera (Figure 2).. . Low-end SoC designs can provide basic functionality and flexibility to accommodate a range of segments within this market. Devices are manufactured in high volumes at low costs. Smart door locks and fitness wearables are typical applications. The segment could also include smart appliances, smart meters, point-of-sale devices, security cameras, and even mousetraps.. Today, SoCs for these use cases can employ I2C to interconnect sensors, but a new interface, MIPI I3C, is targeted to support sensors in IoT and other low-power system architectures with much greater bandwidth while requiring fewer wires in system designs. This new interface was developed with participation from experts across the sensor and mobile industries and is backward compatible with I2C, and will offer a particular advantage in low-end designs because it is complementary to MIPI CSI-2. For example, MIPI I3C is used for the Camera Control Interface (CCI), a sideband channel used to connect the SoC and the image sensor. Furthermore, the MIPI CSI-2 protocol, using the two-wire I3C interface, enables always-on, low-power, low-resolution image capture.. The combination of MIPI CSI-2 and MIPI I3C creates opportunities for designers to add camera features to low-end products. Designers can also use MIPI I3C to build a “superset” SoC that supports value-added features. For example, an SoC that uses MIPI I3C for sensor integration for a simple door lock could incorporate an image sensor with MIPI CSI-2 to support a facial recognition feature in a high-end version of the door lock product.. Lessons learned from the mobile industry for future IoT designs. Designers who are developing IoT SoCs can pursue their designs with confidence by taking advantage of interfaces that have been specifically developed for use in the challenging mobile and mobile-influenced device environments. Many generations of interface specifications, optimized for cost and power, are already proven today, reducing risk and enabling faster adoption.. The specifications continue to evolve to meet new market needs, enabling designers to leverage specification advancements in future designs and to meet their IoT SoC requirements. By segmenting designs for high-end or low-end use cases and applying the required interfaces accordingly, designers can develop their designs with as few wires as possible while ensuring their products provide the power, cost and performance attributes needed to benefit customers and drive market success..

The industry has moved from punch card to keyboard and from mouse to touchscreen, all in pursuit of more direct system manipulation to optimize user experience (UX) in today’s increasingly mobile and interconnected world. These are all abstractions of physical devices, though, and voice control has been heralded as the next step toward a more natural UX. Unfortunately, today’s solutions can’t deliver what machines need to understand – people – resulting in poor performance and no convenient way to control a new generation of voice-only products and services.. One of the biggest impediments to satisfactory voice control performance has been ambient noise, including nearby conversations, outdoor sounds, and reverberation when speaking in certain indoor environments. The use of multiple acoustic microphones and microphone arrays to improve directional acquisition has proven expensive and incapable of adequately isolating the speaker for reliable voice control. Now, a new approach is available that leverages optical lasers and interferometry techniques to gather additional critical information exclusively about the user communicating with a device. Combining this optical information with the output from an acoustic microphone gives automatic speech recognition (ASR) engines something they have never had before – a near-perfect reference audio signal directly from the speaker’s facial vibrations, regardless of noise levels.. Understanding the special challenges of human-to-machine communications. Human-to-machine communications (HMC) technology enables humans to interact with and control a variety of networked devices as quickly and efficiently as possible. While voice is an excellent interface, the problem with using today’s ASR engines for HMC applications is that they have generally been designed for human listeners and typically only perform well if words are spoken clearly and there is no background noise. This, of course, is not the case in a real-world, noisy environment. Machines are incapable of inferring meaning as humans do if background noise periodically drowns out the speaker, and while voice-recognition software can be trained to understand accents and other speech patterns, they cannot be trained to ignore background noise. Solutions must be able to isolate the speaker’s voice from others in the background, as well as from other types of ambient noise.. In tests of voice-recognition solutions in a moving vehicle with windows fully open and with speakers in the background, the word/command recognition rate typically drops to 0 percent (Figure 1). The industry has pursued a number of approaches to solving this problem over the past 20 years but, in general, these efforts have delivered only single-digit percentage improvements in word recognition performance.. . Reducing or eliminating background noise to isolate the speaker’s voice is critical to improving the accuracy of automatic speech recognition engines in HMC applications. Acoustic microphone technology alone does not provide enough directional acquisition capability to achieve this level of speaker isolation, even with multiple microphones and microphone arrays. However, if the output from an acoustic microphone can be paired with additional outputs associated exclusively with the speaker, there is an opportunity to reduce word error rates by at least 60 percent.. Applying optical laser technology and interferometry techniques. The key to improving voice recognition using optical laser technology is the ability to measure the distance and velocity of facial vibrations during speech. This approach takes advantage of the fact that even in an environment full of acoustic vibrations, a person’s facial skin only vibrates during speech.. The optical sensor and acoustic microphone operate alongside each other. The acoustic microphone extracts signals from the air across the full 4-6 KHz range of normal speech, albeit with a high level of non-speaker-related ambient noise. Meanwhile, an eye-safe optical sensor is pointed at a fixed location on the user’s face such as the mouth, lip, cheek, throat, or behind the ear, and picks up only the signals from the facial skin that are transmitted during speech at lower, 1-2 KHz frequencies (Figure 2). It is impervious to noise in this range. Nanometer-resolution interferometry techniques are then used to measure differences in the distance traveled by light as it reflects from these areas. The data is converted into intensity variations, and algorithms filter out any vibrations not associated with the user’s speech. The intensity variations are then converted to signals, which are converted back to sound.. . In essence, the optical HMC sensor creates a virtual “cube” around the speaker. Because vibrations are associated only with the user’s speech, there is an extremely high level of directional pickup and, in turn, near-perfect isolation from extraneous noise and other background voices. No other sounds are detected or sent to the speech recognition engine.. Implementation options. The first implementation option is to connect an HMC optical sensor to the noise reduction section of a voice control solution. This improves noise reduction performance with an associated improvement in speech-recognition performance, creating a platform for significantly improving current products without requiring changes to existing speech recognition architectures.. Alternatively, HMC optical sensors can be connected directly to a speech recognition engine, eliminating the need for noise reduction modification. The speech recognition engine simultaneously processes the acoustic and optical signals and performs all necessary noise compensation using both sets of input.. Using the latter approach, a speech recognition engine leverages the best characteristics of the acoustic microphone and optical sensor. This change to the speech recognition model has interesting implications for not only improving voice control performance but also exploring new use cases in environments that were previously considered prohibitively noisy. Today’s sensor technology is small enough (sub-3 mm form factor) with sufficient power efficiency for use in very small devices, for both head-mounted (virtual and augmented reality glasses, headsets, helmets) and remote (voice-controlled automotive infotainment and access control) applications.. The connected car use case is particularly compelling. Speech recognition has been nearly impossible with windows rolled down and background passenger conversations. With optical HMC sensor technology installed in the infotainment center or rear-view mirror and pointed at the driver, however, all commands are clean and isolated from background noise. The sensor in this application operates at ranges up to 1 m across a field of view that enables typical driver movements.. Speech recognition in head-mounted devices has also been difficult, especially in noisy environments. Adding an optical HMC sensor to the headset isolates the speaker from ambient noise and removes the requirement for acoustic mics to be positioned close to the user’s mouth. Designers can “remove the boom” and create new, more convenient designs and a better user experience in applications including emergency response communications solutions, motorcycle helmets, aviation headphones, and gaming and virtual/augmented reality gear. Optical HMC sensors used in these applications support an up-to-50 mm range when pointed at a fixed location on a user’s face.. New ways to measure performance. In addition to changing how ASR engines operate and creating new voice-control use cases, optical HMC laser technology is also poised to change how the speech-recognition industry measures performance. In the past, performance was typically calculated using a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) that measures intelligibility and whether the experience is a good or bad one from a human user’s perspective. The MOS has been used for decades in the telephony industry to measure quality based on a user’s assessment.. In the HMC world, however, it may be more important to know how many times a command must be given before execution. Early developers of HMC solutions are now looking at such metrics as how much time it takes for a single task to be performed – i.e., using speech recognition to identify the barcode on a box on the factory floor so that an automated transport system can move it from one location to another.. Future developments. As HMC optical sensors move to the higher end of their available frequency range it will be possible to achieve unlimited vocabulary speech recognition, independent of the acoustic microphone.. Another opportunity is to point two or more optical sensors at different locations on the speaker’s face, such as behind the ear and on the jaw in a head-mounted application. Add this to acoustic microphones with noise-cancellation and beam-forming capabilities, and speech recognition engines can benefit from an unprecedented level of speaker isolation for HMC applications plus ultra-high-quality audio for human-to-human communication.. It will also be possible to use a single optical HMC sensor for multiple high-value functions. For instance, optical sensors can perform proximity sensing, touch sensing (which would eliminate the need for buttons on wearable devices), and always-on voice-trigger functions. They also can be used to turn voice into another authentication factor for an expanding range of personalized online and mobile financial, healthcare, smart home automation, and other secure cloud-based services. Implementing a sensor in this way would enable system developers to replace from $10 to $20 in sensors with a single solution that leverages sensor-based interferometry for numerous applications.. The industry is moving into a new generation of capabilities with the Internet of Things and an increasingly connected world. Voice is the optimal UX, but isn’t feasible without dramatic improvements. HMC optical sensor technology provides an important new solution while also creating opportunities for many new voice control applications moving forward..

While much has been made of the Big Data and cloud storage aspects of the Internet of Things (IoT), much less attention has been paid to the growing memory requirements of devices that exist at the edge. Here, as connectivity, security, and demands for localized intelligence increase, so too do the expectations for low cost, small footprint, and minimal power from embedded storage solutions.. A 2016 Top Embedded Innovator, Jeff Bader, Vice President, Embedded Business Unit at Micron Technology, has overseen the growth of an automotive and industrial memory portfolio that now ships more than 1 million parts per day. In this interview with Embedded Computing Design, Bader offers his take on the current memory bottlenecks for IoT edge devices, advances in memory technology and packaging, and a vision for what integrated storage solutions could look like in 5 to 10 years.. Why is storage at the edge of IoT critical, and what memory bottlenecks currently exist there?. BADER: Device storage in the IoT is a rapidly growing area for both memory and digital storage that is growing from the continued distribution of compute and communications capabilities to the edges of an ever-expanding network of connections. As the capability of those edge devices increases, the memory and storage needs within them are increasing as well. At the same time, the challenges of connectivity – bandwidth, latency, and persistence – are driving the need to increase both storage and data intelligence even further in those edge devices.. As the costs of compute and storage continue to decline, it enables the distribution of the data analytics toward the edge, which can provide faster response times, better decision support, or simpler overall system design. Ultimately, we want real-time decisions from our devices, not just data. By leveraging local storage and the intelligence to analyze, devices can provide richer information for upstream analytics engines. In terms of the memory bottlenecks or key memory criteria today, systems are really driving a balance of performance, reliability, and cost in addition to things like power, form factor and longevity, depending on the specific device.. In order to truly see the scale of IoT that has been forecast, the interoperability standards and related security concerns of edge devices need to improve. Recent studies have suggested that a significant percentage of all IoT devices today are lacking even very basic security features, and security at the system level can be significantly improved by secure storage features within memory devices.. What is being done to reduce the cost of storage for embedded/IoT devices? What wafer or process technologies are emerging to enable this?. BADER: Faster adoption of leading edge technology is occurring in embedded applications that traditionally used technology only after it had been adopted and in stable production by mainstream applications. We see this, for example, with the strong adoption of LPDDR4 technology in automotive applications today.. While we do see the adoption of leading edge lithography to enable cost reductions within embedded/IoT devices, this is balanced by a need within these applications for extended lifecycles and higher durability. As a result, memory solutions must be developed that support both cost reductions and improved durability, such as the family of industrial-grade SSDs Micron recently introduced. Another key trend driving system cost reductions is the increasing use of multi-chip packages (MCPs) and system-in-package (SiP) solutions. Integrating DRAM with non-volatile memory in an MCP or combined with an SoC in an SiP solution can deliver significant system cost savings in addition to performance and power benefits.. 5 to 10 years from now, what is going to be the storage architecture of choice for Industrial IoT and embedded systems?. BADER: The crystal ball gets a little foggy 10 years from now, but it’s probably safe to say some of the same key trends we see today will continue in embedded and IoT. For higher function IoT devices, the proliferation of mobile architectures into embedded systems will continue, taking advantage of the scale, performance, and power of those systems. This means advanced DRAM, eMMC, and universal flash storage (UFS) will combine in MCP and package on package (PoP) configurations to deliver the best performance and form factor possible. For lower function devices, we’ll continue to see NOR as the primary boot solution with a growing use of low-density NAND and eMMC. In the longer term we could also see the adoption of emerging memory solutions like Micron’s transistor-less 3D Xpoint technology, which could serve as a simple non-volatile RAM solution replacing (or augmenting) both DRAM and NAND in those devices..

A modern OS can provide a variety of tools to help developers build robust, safety-certifiable systems with off-the-shelf software.. A century ago, removing the horse and replacing it with a motor was a major innovation. Electric starters, automatic transmissions, and radios were next. As electronics became ubiquitous, we saw intermittent wipers, fuel injection, and engine performance enhancements and monitoring. And now, microprocessors and software are fueling the evolution of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to help the driver drive the car.. ADAS spans from passive, to rudimentary, to active, and finally to fully autonomous control. In passive ADAS, the system warns the driver of a situation, but it is up to the driver to take action (Figure 1). For example, a backup camera equipped with a motion detector can, if it detects someone behind the car, sound an alarm, but the driver must still apply the brakes. An example of rudimentary ADAS control is adaptive cruise control, which can maintain the speed set by the driver and automatically adjust it to ensure a safe distance from vehicles up ahead. An example of active ADAS is automated lane keeping, which not only warns the driver, but actively steers the vehicle to keep it in the lane. Ultimately, such technologies will converge in the autonomous vehicle — a car able to drive itself without human intervention.. 
[Figure 1 | Passive ADAS systems, such as backup cameras, still require driver intervention.]. Software. ADAS systems combine hardware (for example, cameras, radar, exotic laser sighting systems) with associated device driver and control software. Additional layers of software provide the communication between modules and implement the system’s “high level” functionality, such as avoiding the pedestrian behind the car while it’s in reverse or coordinating the interaction of the braking system, steering system, and cameras to implement the lane keeping feature. Autonomous cars will require even more software.. To deliver a safe and reliable product, developers must use certified components, methods, and tools, but they must also deal with cost constraints. Thus, to develop the product on time and on budget, it makes sense to use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software. This approach amortizes the development, testing, and certification costs of the software across multiple OEMs. Likewise, commonality of hardware platforms lends strength to the COTS argument – the difference between a high-end luxury car and a low-end utility car can be stark, but they may both use the same underlying vision system. Once an OEM gains familiarity with a hardware platform, they can integrate it into multiple models and lines to reduce costs.. Freedom from interference. The automotive software industry is following in the footsteps of other industries that rely on software and have stringent safety requirements, including medical, rail, and nuclear. Each has processes and certifications to help ensure consistency, quality, and above all, safety. For automotive, the main standard is ISO 26262, “Road Vehicles – Functional Safety.” It’s modeled after IEC 61508 “Functional Safety of Electrical/Electronic/Programmable Electronic Safety-Related Systems,” but deals specifically with the automotive sector and addresses the entire software lifecycle.. A key concept in ISO 26262 is freedom from interference. Simply put, one component cannot interfere with the operations of another. For example, if a system includes both a media player and a rear-view camera, the media player should never interfere with the operation of the camera, even though the two may share the same LCD panel.. The goal of modern OS platforms is to mitigate all forms of interference between software processes. For example, the OS can use the memory management unit (MMU) to ensure that each process runs in a private, hardware-enforced address space that only that process can access. This technique prevents memory interference. But other forms of interference can still occur — for example, in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, a process could consume all available memory or CPU resources, starving the other processes. Thus, an OS also needs to support resource limits and scheduling guarantees.. OS architecture makes the difference here. Microkernel operating systems, in particular, are much better than their monolithic counterparts at ensuring freedom from interference (Figure 2). For example, consider device drivers. In a monolithic OS such as Linux, the device driver software lives in the kernel. Consequently, a fault in one device driver will corrupt or possibly shut down the entire OS. Even from a security perspective this is a serious breach, as compromising the least-secure device driver can give an attacker full control over the OS. In a microkernel OS, though, this isn’t the case. Device drivers operate as regular, minimally privileged, memory-protected processes, isolated from each other (and the kernel) through tried-and-true MMU-enforced hardware protection. If one driver fails, the rest of the system continues to work.. 
[Figure 2 | Microkernel operating systems enable greater freedom from interference.]. Resource limits and adaptive partitioning. Scheduling contention is another interference issue that can occur when multiple processes share a CPU — and cannot be eliminated by simply assigning priorities. To understand why, consider two processes running at the same priority. Due to a bug, one of the processes goes into an infinite loop and runs forever. The other process won’t be scheduled to run because the first process is consuming all available CPU. The solution may appear to be simple: change the priority so that one process has a higher priority than the other. But this simply moves the vulnerability to a different process. When a bug hits the higher priority process, that process starves other processes of CPU time. To prevent task starvation from ever becoming a concern, system designers can use adaptive partitioning, an advanced technique that guarantees CPU time to sets of processes or threads (aka partitions), while allowing partitions to exceed their time budgets when spare processing cycles are available.. With adaptive partitioning, the designer could, for example, allocate 60 percent of the CPU to one process and 40 percent to another. So, even if both processes run at the highest priority, the OS will ensure that the first process consumes only 60 percent of the CPU and the second 40 percent — exactly as specified. Because this approach is “adaptive,” it can hand out spare CPU time to partitions that could benefit from it. For example, if the first partition isn’t using any CPU, and the second partition needs to perform a lot of work, the OS could let the second partition use more than its 40 percent share, so long as it doesn’t impact the operation of the first partition. The instant the first partition needs CPU time, the OS guarantees that it shall have 60 percent of the CPU. This approach effectively provides freedom from interference on the CPU front, in a way that’s both flexible and predictable.. Advanced operating systems provide fine-grained privilege mapping. Every distinct function provided by the kernel, such as setting the time, attaching to an interrupt, or creating a process, is assigned a privilege level. The OS kernel then limits the processes to the absolute minimum privileges required. Processes can be started with “extra” privileges (in order to, for example, set up hardware mappings and attach to interrupts), which they can then drop once in their steady-state operation. The concept of “running as root” is no longer relevant or acceptable.. Hypervisor. An ISO 26262-certified system can also use a hypervisor. As mentioned, adaptive partitioning allows us to run several processes on the same CPU and to make strong guarantees about their interactions with each other. A hypervisor allows us to benefit from two additional configuration options. In one case, we might wish to combine a certified system with a non-certified system, for example, the rear-view camera and the multimedia player. The multimedia player might be subject to more frequent updates and, since it isn’t a critical system, doesn’t need to be certified. A hypervisor can create a clear separation between the certified and non-certified domains in a simple and cost-effective manner.. The hypervisor could also allow the multimedia player to run on a non-certified commodity OS, such as Linux, while allowing the safety-certified critical software to run on a real-time OS, such as QNX Neutrino. Again, the hypervisor provides an effective barrier between the certified part and the non-certified part. The benefits of using a hypervisor include hardware consolidation (one CPU, one LCD panel) and lower certification costs, resulting in a lower overall system cost while retaining safety certification..

Unskilled and careless drivers will be mitigated by a host of active electronic systems that improve safety by taking many decisions out of drivers’ hands. These advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) will be enabled by a network of devices that allow vehicles to detect their surroundings, as well as their drivers’ condition.. Wireless communications are at the helm of the evolution towards connected vehicles and active safety systems. Radar systems are already being used to detect the position of other cars on the road, and cameras are already employed to detect the lines on the road and delineate adjacent lanes. Wireless area networks for road vehicles – which are generally referred to as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and, collectively, as V2X communications – are also being developed to detect traffic coming from a perpendicular direction for crash avoidance, to turn all red traffic lights green when there are no other cars approaching, and to improve efficiency on interstates and other highways.. All of these advanced systems require sophisticated components to operate without fault, 100 percent of the time. An enormous assortment of electronic components already exists for use in automotive Wi-Fi, radar, and high-definition cameras. Historically, however, these components have primarily been used in commercial and consumer applications, which aren’t typically subject to rigorous reliability standards. High-reliability components have been made for the military, down-hole, space, and aerospace industries, and manufacturers within these industries are already accustomed to the higher costs required to develop high-performance, high-reliability devices. The automotive industry is different. Although it requires components that perform just as well, if not better, than commercial-grade parts; that are rugged enough to handle the electrical, mechanical, and environmental rigors of daily driving; and that pass the extensive testing specified by the AEC-Q200 standard, it also requires that said components be affordable enough for high-volume implementation into vehicles.. Multilayer organic components for performance and functionality. A new class of high-performance, high frequency components has been developed to meet the unique demands of the automotive industry. Multilayer organic (MLO) technology utilizes thin, low-loss substrates with excellent, repeatable RF/microwave performance and robust reliability to create components such as filters, couplers, crossovers, capacitors, and inductors. AEC-Q200-qualified RF/microwave capacitors are also available for Bluetooth infotainment systems, and low-inductance ceramic capacitors that can handle the demands of high-speed automotive video processors are available as well.. MLO components consist of one or more RF dielectric layers embedded between other laminates to provide routing, shielding, and bonding pads for surface mount (SMT) placement. MLO technology can also be used as an RF or mixed-signal substrate, in which the layers support the placement of both RF and digital ICs (Figure 1). Variations of this integration can be employed when necessary (for example, when thinner components are required), but there are a few design constants. For instance, the dielectric layer must exhibit low loss at common wireless frequency ranges and, at the same time, also exhibit a high dielectric constant (Dk) to provide high capacitance density.. 
[Figure 1 | A cross-section view of a typical multilayer organic (MLO) device.]. Unfortunately, these are counteracting properties for most materials. High Dk values are usually obtained by filling polymers with dielectric materials, which can increase loss. For this reason, extremely thin dielectric layers are necessary. Recently, a number of low-loss formulations of polytetrafluoroethylene polymers (PTFE) and liquid crystalline polymers (LCP) have become available in copper-clad films as thin as 8 microns. For PTFE, advanced filler materials are used to increase Dk without significantly increasing loss. LCP, on the other hand, has low Dk, and has been shown to have favorable characteristics for a wide variety of RF and high-speed applications. So, by carefully selecting laminates and bond ply materials, it is possible to utilize standard lamination processes to produce high-performance RF components.. Once the MLO component design is completed, metal and dielectric layers are etched and laminated. A typical six-layer construction is shown in Figure 1. These customized configurations are patent protected, and allow for the highest passive component density while achieving increased functionality. To achieve the desired component densities, line widths, and spaces, as small as 15 microns can be obtained using semi-additive process techniques. Laser direct imaging (LDI) technology is also critical to MLO device development, as it allows for the realization of fine line geometries and tight tolerance structures. These structures typically form the resonant structures of the embedded components, and must be precisely reproducible over a large area. A distinct advantage of MLO technology over ceramic- and silicon-based (Si-based) processes is cost. By leveraging the economies of scale, more than 200,000 devices in 0402 packaging can be constructed on a single 18” x 24” panel.. Since MLO technology is used to build high-performance RF/microwave filters and multiplexers, it’s an ideal solution for automotive V2X applications in which radios can utilize the new IEEE 802.11p standard WLAN band that operates at 5.9 GHz (as well as GPS frequencies) to receive the necessary information required to determine the location of vehicles and transmit their location data to surrounding vehicles and infrastructure. Diplexers, which are comprised of two filters connected to a common port, can be used to reduce the component count in V2X radios, as a single diplexer can route the GPS, 5.9 GHz, or other signals through one antenna, effectively removing the need for two independent, discrete filters, additional antennas, and the necessary impedance-matching networks (Figure 2).. 
[Figure 2 | Typical diplexer function is shown here.]. Tests have shown that MLO diplexers exhibit several significant performance advantages, such as steeper roll-offs and higher quality factors above and beyond those exhibited by common ceramic diplexers (Table 1). Additionally, MLO diplexers experience higher repeatability at manufacturing, consistently producing high Q components.. 
[Table 1 | A comparison of the physical and performance characteristics of an MLO diplexer versus an LTCC diplexer.]. MLO devices also have a unique feature that’s not found in other types of components, namely ceramic and silicon: a coefficient of thermal expansion that is matched to the typical printed circuit board (PCB). This is an especially critical characteristic due to the fact that automobiles are constantly exposed to wide temperature swings. For example, in South Carolina during the spring, early morning temperatures can hover around 55 ºF and rise to 85 ºF by noon, with even higher temperatures experienced by a parked car in direct sunlight. These temperature swings cause PCBs to contract and expand, which causes mechanical stress at the solder joints of the capacitors, inductors, filters, ICs, and other devices mounted on the board. Since MLO components expand and contract at the same rate as the PCB, they dramatically reduce the potential for component cracks or broken terminations resulting from the thermal changes experienced over their lifetimes.. However, ceramic capacitors are still (and will likely continue to be) employed in most automotive applications, as they offer the widest range of capacitance values and capabilities. RF/microwave ceramic capacitors are used in infotainment, V2X, and other wireless systems for impedance matching, and AEC-Q200-qualified RF/microwave ceramic capacitors are ideal for Bluetooth radios and Wi-Fi matching circuits.. In addition to the RF/microwave components used for wireless signal transmission, ADAS applications also rely on imaging technology, such as high-definition, high-speed image processors and HD cameras for backup imaging, side lane detection, and driver monitoring systems. These and other applications used to visually detect a vehicle’s surroundings and the driver’s condition require a great deal of processing power at extremely fast data rates, and capacitors are typically used to decouple the image processor from the power source, acting as a buffer between the two. Parasitic inductance is the enemy of high-speed digital circuits, as it tends to distort signals by increasing rise times. To counter this phenomenon, low inductance devices, such as land grid array (LGA) capacitors, have been developed to exhibit parasitic inductances as low as tens of picohenries (pH), compared to several hundred picohenries for standard multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) of similar overall size.. 
[Figure 3 | Pictured are two-terminal LGA ceramic capacitors.]. LGA capacitors are two-terminal ceramic capacitors with a reverse geometry construction and T-shaped, vertically oriented electrodes that significantly reduce inductance (Figure 3). These capacitors are built with another innovative passive component manufacturing process: fine copper termination (FCT), which enables extremely accurate termination plating. Additionally, expanding on the LGA design by introducing more terminals further reduces inductance below 20pH (Figure 4).. . [Figure 4 | An impedance versus frequency comparison of various low inductance ceramic capacitors.]. Over the past five to ten years the automotive industry has undergone significant improvements in automotive safety and efficiency, largely as a result of the expanding employment of advanced electronic systems in vehicles. As a result, passive component manufacturers, such as AVX, have experienced notable demand for high-reliability, high-performance passive components that are capable of satisfying stringent automotive-specific safety and reliability standards; are rugged enough to handle the electrical, mechanical, and environmental rigors of daily driving; and competitive enough to comply with the budgetary restrictions of high-volume purchasing, and have subsequently invested significant resources in processes to qualify said devices to the AEC-Q200 standard and various individual automotive OEM standards, to keep drivers and passengers safe..

Paratha is one of the staple foods of Punjabi cuisine and Punjabis cannot do without it. Ideally considered as part of the breakfast, parathas are something that Punjabis can have all day and not get tired of eating. The reason why parathas are enjoyed as breakfast is, they were earlier made with ghee and enjoyed with a glass full of chaach or lassi, giving energy to the men of the house for working all day in the fields. Parathas are generally stuffed and you can use any vegetable for stuffing per se and there is no dearth of vegetables for making a paratha. Here is the recipe for one of the popular parathas - Aloo Paratha, in which the main ingredient is aloo or potato. It is a simple and easy-to-make paratha recipe that can be made in the time frame of half an hour. Punjabi mothers love feeding their kids and make paratha with lots of ghee, which is further enjoyed with white butter (known as safed makkhan) or thick curd. These days, people also love to have aloo paratha with pickle of different kinds and dal/sabji. This stuffed flatbread is also popular outside India as well and is made using different spices. It is one of the basic parathas that you can easily cook at home when nothing strikes you. All you need to prepare this easy recipe is: Wheat flour, boiled potatoes, green chillies, coriander leaves, red chilli powder, black pepper and asafoetida along with a little carom seeds, and last but not the least garam masala powder, which is the soul of Punjabi cuisine. This recipe used both carom seeds and asafoetida, as potatoes are highly gastric and can put a bad effect on your stomach. In order to soothe the stomach, we have used both these ingredients, however, you can choose any one of them. Also, some people use finely chopped onions in the recipe for a little crunchiness and to increase the flavour of these parathas. The key to making flawless, tastier and soft Aloo Paratha is to mash the potatoes well using a masher or you can also grate the potatoes for giving a fine touch to mashed potatoes. So, don’t wait any longer and try this easy recipe of Aloo Paratha and enjoy with lassi, butter, curd or pickle. . To prepare this mouth-watering and popular Aloo Paratha recipe, boil the potatoes and mash them in a large bowl. In the potatoes, add chopped onions, coriander leaves, salt, garam masala powder, and red chilli powder. Mix well so that no lumps remain. Ensure that you have finely chopped the onions or the filling will come out.. Put wheat flour in a large mixing bowl. Add water gradually and knead into a soft dough. Make small-medium balls of the dough and roll them out into 3 to 4-inch circles. Add a spoonful of potato filling in the centre. Gradually press the rolling pin on all sides while making the parathas. Be very careful to apply pressure evenly. It is very important to ensure that your potato mixture is mashed well and not lumpy or you will never be able to make perfect parathas. Seal the dough and round it with your fingers. Now roll them with a rolling pin into round parathas. Apply the pressure very evenly and gently on all sides. Press very lightly so that the mixture does not come out.. Heat a girdle and roast the parathas, cooking them on both the sides with a spoonful of ghee. If you want to use less ghee on the parathas, first roast them on both the sides on low flame and when they are slightly crispy, apply ghee with a kitchen brush on both the sides.. Serve piping hot with chilled yoghurt or pickle. You can also serve the aloo parathas with green chutney or coconut chutney or a light gravy. Ideally, a light potato shorba goes best with aloo ka paratha. You can also make quick onion-tomato-green chilli raita that tastes amazing with this paratha..

This will add a nice aroma and creamy texture to your favourite culinary delight. You can prepare this quick recipe when you have sudden guests dropping by. To make the kidney beans (Rajma) more soft, it is advisable to soak the seeds overnight with a small pinch of salt. Also, if you forgot to soak the kidney beans overnight, you can still make it. Just take a bowl and add washed beans in it with a pinch of salt, mix well and microwave the rajma for 15-20 minutes. Once you do this, you will not need them to be soaked overnight. So try this super delicious North Indian recipe and relish it with your loved ones.. To prepare this easy Punjabi Rajma recipe, soak the kidney beans in water for around 8 hours. Then, take a pressure cooker and add the kidney beans, water and salt in it. Pressure cook the soaked kidney beans with salt for about 20 minutes or till they become soft. Once done, strain the excess water.. Now, put a pan and heat refined oil in it on medium flame. When the oil is hot enough, add grated onions in it and fry till they turn slightly pinkish in colour. Next, add ginger-garlic paste and cook for about 2-3 minutes. Stir well and then add yoghurt in the pan, and cook on low heat for 2 more minutes.. Now, add tomato puree and turmeric powder in the pan, and cook for about 5-7 minutes. Keep stirring the ingredients so that they don't stick to the bottom of the pan. Afterwards, add coriander powder, cumin powder along with kasoori methi powder and chilli powder in the pan. Cook till oil floats to the surface.. Once done, add in the cooked kidney beans and bring it to a boil. After 2 minutes, add salt and simmer the dish for around 15 minutes. Garnish with chopped coriander and garam masala powder. You may also add a dollop of cream for a creamy flavour. You can serve this delicious Punjabi Rajma recipe with boiled rice, jeera rice or even plain rotis.. 1. To cook the Punjabi Rajma, it’s always better to choose Chitra Rajma than the red ones and soak them for about 8-9 hours or overnight.

This will prevent the syrup from granulating later. Also add gulab jal and cardamom powder. Switch off the gas.. Take the chhena from the muslin cloth and keep rubbing portions of it from your hand. At this point add the maida. You have to rub it so much that it becomes completely smooth and starts releasing a little oil. Once your chhena is smooth enough and much lighter in texture, make smooth round balls and keep aside.. Meanwhile heat the sugar syrup again, till it reaches a boiling point. Make sure you make small balls as they will swell up once they absorb the syrup. Add the rasgullas one by one in the syrup ensuring there is enough space in the pan. Boil for 5-7 minutes on low flame. Do not stir.. Now cover the pan and allow it to simmer on low flame for 5-7 minutes.
